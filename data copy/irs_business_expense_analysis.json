The Inter-\nnal Revenue Service is a proud partner with the \nNational Center for Missing & Exploited \nChildren\u00ae (NCMEC) . Photographs of missing \nchildren selected by the Center may appear in \nthis publication on pages that would otherwise \nbe blank. You can help bring these children \nhome by looking at the photographs and calling \n1-800-THE- LOST (1 -800-843- 5678) (24 hours \na day, 7 days a week) if you recognize a child.\nPreventing slavery and human trafficking. \nHuman trafficking is a form of modern -day slav-\nery, and involves the use of force, fraud, or co-\nercion to exploit human beings for some type of \nlabor or commercial sex purpose. The United \nStates is a source, transit, and destination \ncountry for men, women, and children, both \nU.S. citizens and foreign nationals, who are \nsubjected to the injustices of slavery and hu-\nman trafficking, including forced labor, debt \nbondage, involuntary servitude, \u201cmail -order\u201d \nmarriages, and sex trafficking. Trafficking in \npersons can occur in both lawful and illicit in-\ndustries or markets, including in hotel services, \nhospitality, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial \nservices, construction, health and elder care, \ndomestic service, brothels, massage parlors, \nand street prostitution, among others.\nThe President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to \nMonitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n(PITF)  brings together federal departments and \nagencies to ensure a whole -of-government ap-\nproach that addresses all aspects of human \ntrafficking. Online resources for recognizing and \nreporting trafficking activities, and assisting vic-\ntims include the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) Blue Campaign at DHS.gov/blue-\ncampaign , the Department of State Office to \nMonitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at \nState.gov/j/tip , and the National Human Traf-\nficking Resource Center (NHTRC) at \nhumantraffickinghotline.org . DHS is responsible \nfor investigating human trafficking, arresting \ntraffickers, and protecting victims. DHS also \nprovides immigration relief  to non -U.S. citizen \nvictims of human trafficking. DHS uses a victim-\ncentered approach  to combating human traf-\nficking, which places equal value on identifying \nand stabilizing victims and on investigating and \nprosecuting traffickers. Victims are crucial to in-\nvestigations and prosecutions; each case and \nevery conviction changes lives. DHS under-\nstands how difficult it can be for victims to come \nforward and work with law enforcement due to \ntheir trauma. DHS is committed to helping vic-\ntims feel stable, safe, and secure.To report suspected human trafficking, call \nthe DHS domestic 24 -hour toll -free number at \n866-DHS- 2-ICE (866 -347- 2423) or \n802-872- 6199 (non -toll- free international). For \nhelp from the NHTRC, call the National Human \nTrafficking Hotline toll free at 888 -373- 7888 or \ntext HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733).\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Fi-\nnancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) \nhas issued a public advisory to financial institu-\ntions that contains red flag indicators for poten-\ntial suspicious financial activity associated with \nhuman trafficking. If warranted, financial institu-\ntions should file a Suspicious Activity Report \n(FinCEN 112) with FinCEN to report these ac-\ntivities. For more information, go to Fincen.gov/\nSites/default/files/advisory/FIN-2014-A008.pdf .\n1.\nDeducting \nBusiness \nExpenses\nIntroduction\nThis chapter covers the general rules for de-\nducting business expenses. Business expen-\nses are the costs of carrying on a trade or busi-\nness, and they are usually deductible if the \nbusiness is operated to make a profit.\nTopics\nThis chapter discusses:\n\u2022What you can deduct\n\u2022How much you can deduct\n\u2022When you can deduct\n\u2022Not-for-profit activities\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\nPublication\n334 Tax Guide for Small Business\n463 Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses\n525 Taxable and Nontaxable Income\n529 Miscellaneous Deductions\n536 Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for \nIndividuals, Estates, and Trusts\n538 Accounting Periods and Methods\n542 Corporations\n547 Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts\n583 Starting a Business and Keeping \nRecords\n587 Business Use of Your Home  334 \n  463 \n  525 \n  529 \n  536 \n  538 \n  542 \n  547 \n  583 \n  587 925 Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules\n936 Home Mortgage Interest\nDeduction\n946 How To Depreciate Property\nForm (and Instructions)\nSchedule A (Form 1040) Itemized \nDeductions\n5213 Election To Postpone\nDetermination as To Whether the \nPresumption Applies That an\nActivity Is Engaged in for Profit\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nWhat Can I Deduct?\nTo be deductible, a business expense must be \nboth ordinary and necessary. An ordinary ex-\npense is one that is common and accepted in \nyour industry. A necessary expense is one that \nis helpful and appropriate for your trade or busi-\nness. An expense does not have to be indis-\npensable to be considered necessary.\nEven though an expense may be ordinary \nand necessary, you may not be allowed to de-\nduct the expense in the year you paid or incur-\nred it. In some cases, you may not be allowed \nto deduct the expense at all. Therefore, it is im-\nportant to distinguish usual business expenses \nfrom expenses that include the following.\n\u2022The expenses used to figure cost of goods \nsold.\n\u2022Capital expenses.\n\u2022Personal expenses.\nCost of Goods Sold\nIf your business manufactures products or pur-\nchases them for resale, you must generally \nvalue inventory at the beginning and end of \neach tax year to determine your cost of goods \nsold. Some of your business expenses may be \nincluded in figuring cost of goods sold. Cost of \ngoods sold is deducted from your gross re-\nceipts to figure your gross profit for the year. If \nyou include an expense in the cost of goods \nsold, you cannot deduct it again as a business \nexpense.\nThe following are types of expenses that go \ninto figuring cost of goods sold.\n\u2022The cost of products or raw materials, in-\ncluding freight.\n\u2022Storage.\n\u2022Direct labor (including contributions to pen-\nsion or annuity plans) for workers who pro-\nduce the products.\n\u2022Factory overhead.\nUnder the uniform capitalization rules, you \nmust capitalize the direct costs and part of the \nindirect costs for certain production or resale \nactivities. Indirect costs include rent, interest, \ntaxes, storage, purchasing, processing, repack-\naging, handling, and administrative costs.\nThis rule does not apply to small business \ntaxpayers. You qualify as a small business tax-\npayer if you (a) have average annual gross   925 \n  936 \n  946 \n  Schedule A (Form 1040)\n  5213 Page 3 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

See Pub. 538 for \nmore information.\nFor more information, see the following \nsources.\n\u2022Cost of goods sold\u2014chapter 6 of Pub. \n334.\n\u2022Inventories\u2014Pub. 538.\n\u2022Uniform capitalization rules\u2014Pub. 538 and \nsection 263A and the related regulations.\nCapital Expenses\nYou must capitalize, rather than deduct, some \ncosts. These costs are a part of your investment \nin your business and are called \u201ccapital expen-\nses.\u201d Capital expenses are considered assets \nin your business. In general, you capitalize \nthree types of costs.\n\u2022Business startup costs (see Tip below).\n\u2022Business assets.\n\u2022Improvements.\nYou can elect to deduct or amortize \ncertain business startup costs. See \nchapters 7  and 8.\nCost recovery.  Although you generally cannot \ntake a current deduction for a capital expense, \nyou may be able to recover the amount you \nspend through depreciation, amortization, or \ndepletion. These recovery methods allow you to \ndeduct part of your cost each year. In this way, \nyou are able to recover your capital expense. \nSee Amortization  (chapter 8) and Depletion \n(chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can \nelect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain \ndepreciable property as a section 179 deduc-\ntion. A greater portion of these costs can be de-\nducted if the property is qualified disaster assis-\ntance property. See Pub. 946 for details.\nGoing Into Business\nThe costs of getting started in business, before \nyou actually begin business operations, are \ncapital expenses. These costs may include ex-\npenses for advertising, travel, or wages for \ntraining employees.\nIf you go into business.  When you go into \nbusiness, treat all costs you had to get your \nbusiness started as capital expenses.\nUsually, you recover costs for a particular \nasset through depreciation. Generally, you can-\nnot recover other costs until you sell the busi-\nness or otherwise go out of business. However, \nyou can choose to amortize certain costs for \nsetting up your business. See Starting a Busi-\nness  in chapter 8  for more information on busi-\nness startup costs.\nTIPIf your attempt to go into business is un-\nsuccessful.  If you are an individual and your \nattempt to go into business is not successful, \nthe expenses you had in trying to establish \nyourself in business fall into two categories.\n1.The costs you had before making a deci-\nsion to acquire or begin a specific busi-\nness. These costs are personal and non-\ndeductible. They include any costs \nincurred during a general search for, or \npreliminary investigation of, a business or \ninvestment possibility.\n2.The costs you had in your attempt to ac-\nquire or begin a specific business. These \ncosts are capital expenses and you can \ndeduct them as a capital loss.\nIf you are a corporation and your attempt to \ngo into a new trade or business is not success-\nful, you may be able to deduct all investigatory \ncosts as a loss.\nThe costs of any assets acquired during \nyour unsuccessful attempt to go into business \nare a part of your basis in the assets. You can-\nnot take a deduction for these costs. You will re-\ncover the costs of these assets when you dis-\npose of them.\nBusiness Assets\nThere are many different kinds of business as-\nsets, for example, land, buildings, machinery, \nfurniture, trucks, patents, and franchise rights. \nYou must fully capitalize the cost of these as-\nsets, including freight and installation charges.\nCertain property you produce for use in your \ntrade or business must be capitalized under the \nuniform capitalization rules. See Regulations \nsection 1.263A-2 for information on these rules.\nDe Minimis Safe Harbor for \nTangible Property\nAlthough you must generally capitalize costs to \nacquire or produce real or tangible personal \nproperty used in your trade or business, such \nas buildings, equipment, or furniture, you can \nelect to use a de minimis safe harbor to deduct \nthe costs of some tangible property. Under the \nde minimis safe harbor for tangible property, \nyou can deduct de minimis amounts paid to ac-\nquire or produce certain tangible business prop-\nerty if these amounts are deducted by you for fi-\nnancial accounting purposes or in keeping your \nbooks and records. See the following for the re-\nquirements for the de minimis safe harbor.\nYou have an applicable financial statement. \nIf you elect the de minimis safe harbor for the \ntax year, you can deduct amounts paid to ac-\nquire or produce certain tangible business prop-\nerty if:\n\u2022You have a trade or business or are a cor-\nporation, partnership, or S corporation that \nhas an applicable financial statement;\n\u2022You have, at the beginning of the tax year, \nwritten accounting procedures treating as \nan expense for nontax purposes:\n \u2013 Amounts paid for property costing \nless than a certain dollar amount, or \u2013 Amounts paid for property with an \neconomic useful life of 12 months or \nless;\n\u2022You treat the amount paid during the tax \nyear for which you make the election as an \nexpense on your applicable financial state-\nments in accordance with your written ac-\ncounting procedures;\n\u2022The amount paid for the property does not \nexceed $5,000 per invoice (or per item \nsubstantiated by invoice); and\n\u2022The uniform capitalization rules do not ap-\nply to the amount.\nYou do not have an applicable financial \nstatement.  If you elect the de minimis safe \nharbor for the tax year, you can deduct amounts \npaid to acquire or produce certain tangible busi-\nness property if:\n\u2022You have a trade or business, partnership, \nor S corporation that does not have an ap-\nplicable financial statement;\n\u2022You have, at the beginning of the tax year, \naccounting procedures treating as an ex-\npense for nontax purposes:\n \u2013 Amounts paid for property costing \nless than a certain dollar amount, or\n \u2013 Amounts paid for property with an \neconomic useful life of 12 months or \nless;\n\u2022You treat the amounts paid for the property \nas an expense on your books and records \nin accordance with your accounting proce-\ndures;\n\u2022The amount paid for the property does not \nexceed $2,500 per invoice (or per item \nsubstantiated by invoice); and\n\u2022The uniform capitalization rules do not ap-\nply to the amounts.\nHow to make the de minimis safe harbor \nelection.  To elect the de minimis safe harbor \nfor the tax year, attach a statement to the tax-\npayer\u2019s timely filed original tax return (including \nextensions) for the tax year when qualifying \namounts were paid. The statement must be ti-\ntled \u201cSection 1. 263(a)- 1(f) de minimis safe har-\nbor election\u201d and must include your name, ad-\ndress, taxpayer identification number (TIN), and \na statement that you are making the de minimis \nsafe harbor election under section 1.263(a)-1(f). \nIn the case of a consolidated group filing a con-\nsolidated income tax return, the election is \nmade for each member of the consolidated \ngroup.\nIn the case of a consolidated group filing a \nconsolidated income tax return, the election is \nmade for each member of the consolidated \ngroup. In the case of an S corporation or a part-\nnership, the election is made by the S corpora-\ntion or the partnership and not by the share-\nholders or partners. The election applies only \nfor the tax year for which it is made.\nExample.  In 2022, you do not have an ap-\nplicable financial statement and you purchase \nfive laptop computers for use in your trade or \nbusiness. You paid $2,000 each for a total cost \nof $10,000 and these amounts are substanti-\nated in an invoice. You had an accounting pro-\ncedure in place at the beginning of 2022 to ex-\npense the cost of tangible property if the \nproperty costs $2,000 or less. You treat each \ncomputer as an expense on your books and Page 4 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

        "content": "records for 2022 in accordance with this policy. \nIf you elect the de minimis safe harbor in your \ntax returns for your 2022 tax year, you can de-\nduct the cost of each $2,000 computer.\nImprovements\nGenerally, you must capitalize the costs of mak-\ning improvements to a business asset if the im-\nprovements result in a betterment to the unit of \nproperty, restore the unit of property, or adapt \nthe unit of property to a new or different use.\nSome examples of improvements include \nrewiring or replumbing of a building, replacing \nan entire roof, increasing the production output \nof your equipment, putting an addition on your \nbuilding, strengthening the foundation of a \nbuilding so you can use it for a new purpose, or \nreplacing a major component or substantial \nstructural part of a machine.\nHowever, you may currently deduct the \ncosts of repairs or maintenance that do not im-\nprove a unit of property. This generally includes \nthe costs of routine repairs and maintenance to \nyour property that result from your use of the \nproperty and that keep your property in an ordi-\nnary, efficient operating condition. For example, \ndeductible repairs include costs such as paint-\ning exteriors or interiors of business buildings, \nrepairing broken windowpanes, replacing \nworn- out minor parts, sealing cracks and leaks, \nand changing oil or other fluids to maintain busi-\nness equipment.\nRoutine maintenance safe harbor.  If you \ndetermine that your cost was for an improve-\nment to a building or equipment, you can de-\nduct your cost under the routine maintenance \nsafe harbor. Under the routine maintenance \nsafe harbor, you can deduct the costs of an im-\nprovement that meets all of the following crite-\nria.\n\u2022It is paid for recurring activities performed \non tangible property.\n\u2022It arises from the use of the property in \nyour trade or business.\n\u2022It keeps your property in an ordinary, effi-\ncient operating condition.\n\u2022You reasonably expect, at the time the \nproperty is placed in service, to perform \nthis activity:\n \u2013 For buildings and building systems, \nmore than once during the 10-year pe-\nriod after you place the building in \nservice; or\n \u2013 For other property, more than once \nduring the class life of the particular \ntype of property. For class lives, see \nRevenue Procedure 88-57, 1987-2 \nC.B. 674.\nCosts incurred during an improvement. \nYou must capitalize both the direct and indirect \ncosts of an improvement. Indirect costs include \nrepairs and other expenses that directly benefit \nor are incurred by reason of your improvement. \nFor example, if you improve the electrical sys-\ntem in your building, you must also capitalize \nthe costs of repairing the holes that you made in \nwalls to install the new wiring. This rule applies \neven if this work, performed by itself, would oth-erwise be treated as currently deductible repair \ncosts.\nElection to capitalize repair and mainte-\nnance costs.  You can elect to capitalize and \ndepreciate certain amounts paid for repair and \nmaintenance of tangible property, even if they \ndo not improve your property. To qualify for this \nelection, you must treat these amounts as capi-\ntal expenditures on your books and records \nused in figuring your income. If you make this \nelection, you must apply it to all repair and \nmaintenance costs of tangible property that you \ntreat as capital expenditures on your books and \nrecords for this tax year. To make the election \nto treat repairs and maintenance as capital ex-\npenditures, attach a statement titled \u201cSection \n1.263(a)- 3(n) Election\u201d to your timely filed origi-\nnal tax return (including extensions) and include \nyour name and address, TIN, and a statement \nthat you elect to capitalize repair and mainte-\nnance costs under section 1. 263(a)- 3(n). You \nmust treat these amounts as improvements to \nyour tangible property and begin to depreciate \nthese amounts when the improvement is placed \nin service.\nCapital Versus Deductible \nExpenses\nTo help you distinguish between capital and de-\nductible expenses, different examples are given \nbelow.\nMotor vehicles.  You usually capitalize the \ncost of a motor vehicle you use in your busi-\nness. You can recover its cost through annual \ndeductions for depreciation.\nThere are dollar limits on the depreciation \nyou can claim each year on passenger automo-\nbiles used in your business. See Pub. 463 for \nmore information.\nGenerally, repairs you make to your busi-\nness vehicle are currently deductible. However, \namounts you pay to improve your business ve-\nhicle are generally capital expenditures and are \nrecovered through depreciation.\nRoads and driveways.  The cost of building a \nprivate road on your business property and the \ncost of replacing a gravel driveway with a con-\ncrete one are capital expenses you may be able \nto depreciate. The cost of maintaining a private \nroad on your business property is a deductible \nexpense.\nTools. Unless the uniform capitalization rules \napply, amounts spent for tools used in your \nbusiness are deductible expenses if the tools \nhave a life expectancy of less than 1 year or \nthey cost $200 or less per item or invoice.\nMachinery parts.  Unless the uniform capitali-\nzation rules apply, the cost of replacing \nshort- lived parts of a machine to keep it in good \nworking condition, but not to improve the ma-\nchine, is a deductible expense.\nHeating equipment.  The cost of changing \nfrom one heating system to another is a capital \nexpense.Deduction for qualified business income. \nFor tax years beginning after 2017, you may be \nentitled to take a deduction of up to 20% of your \nqualified business income from your qualified \ntrade or business, plus 20% of the aggregate \namount of qualified real estate investment trust \n(REIT) and qualified publicly traded partnership \nincome. The deduction is subject to various lim-\nitations, such as limitations based on the type of \nyour trade or business, your taxable income, \nthe amount of W -2 wages paid with respect to \nthe qualified trade or business, and the unad-\njusted basis of qualified property held by your \ntrade or business. You will claim this deduction \non Form 1040 or 1040 -SR, not on Schedule C. \nUnlike other deductions, this deduction can be \ntaken in addition to the standard or itemized de-\nductions. For more information, see the Instruc-\ntions for Form 1040.\nPersonal Versus Business \nExpenses\nGenerally, you cannot deduct personal, living, \nor family expenses. However, if you have an ex-\npense for something that is used partly for busi-\nness and partly for personal purposes, divide \nthe total cost between the business and per-\nsonal parts. You can deduct the business part.\nFor example, if you borrow money and use \n70% of it for business and the other 30% for a \nfamily vacation, you can generally deduct 70% \nof the interest as a business expense. The re-\nmaining 30% is personal interest and is gener-\nally not deductible. See chapter 4  for informa-\ntion on deducting interest and the allocation \nrules.\nBusiness use of your home.  If you use part \nof your home for business, you may be able to \ndeduct expenses for the business use of your \nhome. These expenses may include mortgage \ninterest, insurance, utilities, repairs, and depre-\nciation.\nTo qualify to claim expenses for the busi-\nness use of your home, you must meet both of \nthe following tests.\n1.The business part of your home must be \nused exclusively and regularly for your \ntrade or business.\n2.The business part of your home must be:\na.Your principal place of business;\nb.A place where you meet or deal with \npatients, clients, or customers in the \nnormal course of your trade or busi-\nness; or\nc.A separate structure (not attached to \nyour home) used in connection with \nyour trade or business.\nYou generally do not have to meet the ex-\nclusive use test for the part of your home that \nyou regularly use either for the storage of inven-\ntory or product samples, or as a daycare facility.\nYour home office qualifies as your principal \nplace of business if you meet the following re-\nquirements.\n\u2022You use the office exclusively and regu-\nlarly for administrative or management ac-\ntivities of your trade or business.Page 5 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Individual \ntaxpayers can use the optional safe harbor \nmethod to determine the amount of deductible \nexpenses attributable to certain business use of \na residence during the tax year. This method is \nan alternative to the calculation, allocation, and \nsubstantiation of actual expenses.\nThe deduction under the optional method is \nlimited to $1,500 per year based on $5 per \nsquare foot for up to 300 square feet. Under this \nmethod, you claim your allowable mortgage in-\nterest, real estate taxes, and casualty losses on \nthe home as itemized deductions on Sched-\nule A (Form 1040). You are not required to allo-\ncate these deductions between personal and \nbusiness use, as is required under the regular \nmethod. If you use the optional method, you \ncannot depreciate the portion of your home \nused in a trade or business.\nBusiness expenses unrelated to the home, \nsuch as advertising, supplies, and wages paid \nto employees, are still fully deductible. All of the \nrequirements discussed earlier under Business \nuse of your home  still apply.\nFor more information on the deduction for \nbusiness use of your home, including the op-\ntional safe harbor method, see Pub. 587.\nIf you were entitled to deduct deprecia-\ntion on the part of your home used for \nbusiness, you cannot exclude the part \nof the gain from the sale of your home that \nequals any depreciation you deducted (or could \nhave deducted) for periods after May 6, 1997.\nBusiness use of your car.  If you use your car \nexclusively in your business, you can deduct \ncar expenses. If you use your car for both busi-\nness and personal purposes, you must divide \nyour expenses based on actual mileage. Gen-\nerally, commuting expenses between your \nhome and your business location, within the \narea of your tax home, are not deductible.\nYou can deduct actual car expenses, which \ninclude depreciation (or lease payments), gas \nand oil, tires, repairs, tune -ups, insurance, and \nregistration fees. Or, instead of figuring the \nbusiness part of these actual expenses, you \nmay be able to use the standard mileage rate to \nfigure your deduction. For 2022, the standard \nmileage rate is 58.5 cents per mile before July \n1, 2022, and 62.5 cents per mile on or after July \n1, 2022. To find the standard mileage rate for \n2023, go to IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/\nStandard-Mileage-Rates .\nIf you are self -employed, you can also de-\nduct the business part of interest on your car \nloan, state and local personal property tax on \nthe car, parking fees, and tolls, whether or not \nyou claim the standard mileage rate.\nCAUTION!For more information on car expenses and \nthe rules for using the standard mileage rate, \nsee Pub. 463.\nHow Much Can I \nDeduct?\nGenerally, you can deduct the full amount of a \nbusiness expense if it meets the criteria of ordi-\nnary and necessary and it is not a capital ex-\npense.\nRecovery of amount deducted (tax benefit \nrule). If you recover part of an expense in the \nsame tax year in which you would have claimed \na deduction, reduce your current year expense \nby the amount of the recovery. If you have a re-\ncovery in a later year, include the recovered \namount in income in that year. However, if part \nof the deduction for the expense did not reduce \nyour tax, you do not have to include that part of \nthe recovered amount in income.\nFor more information on recoveries and the \ntax benefit rule, see Pub. 525.\nPayments in kind.  If you provide services to \npay a business expense, the amount you can \ndeduct is limited to your out -of-pocket costs. \nYou cannot deduct the cost of your own labor.\nSimilarly, if you pay a business expense in \ngoods or other property, you can deduct only \nwhat the property costs you. If these costs are \nincluded in the cost of goods sold, do not de-\nduct them again as a business expense.\nLimits on losses.  If your deductions for an in-\nvestment or business activity are more than the \nincome it brings in, you have a loss. There may \nbe limits on how much of the loss you can de-\nduct.\nNot-for- profit limits.  If you carry on your \nbusiness activity without the intention of making \na profit, you cannot use a loss from it to offset \nother income. For more information, see \nNot-for-Profit Activities , later.\nAt-risk limits.  Generally, a deductible loss \nfrom a trade or business or other income -pro-\nducing activity is limited to the investment you \nhave \u201cat risk\u201d in the activity. You are at risk in \nany activity for the following.\n1.The money and adjusted basis of property \nyou contribute to the activity.\n2.Amounts you borrow for use in the activity \nif:\na.You are personally liable for repay-\nment, or\nb.You pledge property (other than prop-\nerty used in the activity) as security for \nthe loan.\nFor more information, see Pub. 925.\nPassive activities.  Generally, you are in a \npassive activity if you have a trade or business \nactivity in which you do not materially partici-\npate, or a rental activity. In general, deductions \nfor losses from passive activities only offset in-\ncome from passive activities. You cannot use \nany excess deductions to offset other income. In addition, passive activity credits can only off-\nset the tax on net passive income. Any excess \nloss or credits are carried over to later years. \nSuspended passive losses are fully deductible \nin the year you completely dispose of the activ-\nity. For more information, see Pub. 925.\nNet operating loss (NOL).  If your deduc-\ntions are more than your income for the year, \nyou may have an NOL. You can use an NOL to \nlower your taxes in other years. See Pub. 536 \nfor more information.\nSee Pub. 542 for information about NOLs of \ncorporations.\nWhen Can I\nDeduct an Expense?\nWhen you can deduct an expense depends on \nyour accounting method. An accounting \nmethod is a set of rules used to determine when \nand how income and expenses are reported. \nThe two basic methods are the cash method \nand the accrual method. Whichever method \nyou choose must clearly reflect income.\nFor more information on accounting meth-\nods, see Pub. 538.\nCash method.  Under the cash method of ac-\ncounting, you generally deduct business expen-\nses in the tax year you pay them.\nAccrual method.  Under the accrual method \nof accounting, you generally deduct business \nexpenses when both of the following apply.\n1.The all-events test has been met. The test \nis met when:\na.All events have occurred that fix the \nfact of liability, and\nb.The liability can be determined with \nreasonable accuracy.\n2.Economic performance has occurred.\nEconomic performance.  You generally \ncannot deduct or capitalize a business expense \nuntil economic performance occurs. If your ex-\npense is for property or services provided to \nyou, or for your use of property, economic per-\nformance occurs as the property or services are \nprovided, or the property is used. If your ex-\npense is for property or services you provide to \nothers, economic performance occurs as you \nprovide the property or services.\nExample.  Your tax year is the calendar \nyear. In December 2022, the Field Plumbing \nCompany did some repair work at your place of \nbusiness and sent you a bill for $600. You paid \nit by check in January 2023.

        "content": "insurance premiums, and any other prepaid ex-\npense that creates an intangible asset. If you \npay an amount that creates an intangible asset, \nthen you must capitalize the amounts paid and \nbegin to amortize the payment over the appro-\npriate period.\nHowever, you do not have to capitalize \namounts for creating an intangible asset if the \nright or benefit created does not extend beyond \nthe earlier of 12 months after the date that you \nfirst receive the right or benefit or the end of the \ntax year following the year in which you made \nthe advance payment. If you are a cash method \ntaxpayer and your advance payment qualifies \nfor this exception, then you can generally de-\nduct the amount when paid. If you are an ac-\ncrual method taxpayer, you cannot deduct the \namount until the all -events test has been met \nand economic performance has occurred.\nExample 1.  In 2022, you sign a 10 -year \nlease and immediately pay your rent for the first \n3 years. Even though you paid the rent for \n2022, 2023, and 2024, you can only deduct the \nrent for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You can \ndeduct the rent for 2023 and 2024 on your tax \nreturns for those years.\nExample 2.  You are a cash method calen-\ndar year taxpayer. On December 1, 2022, you \nsign a 12 -month lease, effective beginning Jan-\nuary 1, 2023, and immediately pay your rent for \nthe entire 12 -month period that begins on Janu-\nary 1, 2023. The right or benefit attributable to \nthe payment neither extends more than 12 \nmonths beyond January 1, 2023 (the first day \nthat you are entitled to use the property) nor be-\nyond the tax year ending December 31, 2023 \n(the year following the year in which you made \nthe advance payment). Therefore, your prepay-\nment does not have to be capitalized, and you \ncan deduct the entire payment in the year you \npay it.\nContested liability.  Under the cash method, \nyou can deduct a contested liability only in the \nyear you pay the liability. Under the accrual \nmethod, you can deduct contested liabilities \nsuch as taxes (except foreign or U.S. posses-\nsion income, war profits, and excess profits \ntaxes) either in the tax year you pay the liability \n(or transfer money or other property to satisfy \nthe obligation) or in the tax year you settle the \ncontest. However, to take the deduction in the \nyear of payment or transfer, you must meet cer-\ntain conditions. See Regulations section \n1.461-2.\nRelated person.  Under the accrual method of \naccounting, you generally deduct expenses \nwhen you incur them, even if you have not yet \npaid them. However, if you and the person you \nowe are related and that person uses the cash \nmethod of accounting, you must pay the ex-\npense before you can deduct it. Your deduction \nis allowed when the amount is includible in in-\ncome by the related cash method payee. For \nmore information, see Related Persons  in Pub. \n538.Not-for-Profit Activities\nIf you do not carry on your business or invest-\nment activity to make a profit, you cannot use a \nloss from the activity to offset other income. Ac-\ntivities you do as a hobby, or mainly for sport or \nrecreation, are often not entered into for profit.\nThe limit on not -for-profit losses applies to \nindividuals, partnerships, estates, trusts, and S \ncorporations. It does not apply to corporations \nother than S corporations.\nIn determining whether you are carrying on \nan activity for profit, several factors are taken \ninto account. No one factor alone is decisive. \nAmong the factors to consider are whether:\n\u2022You carry on the activity in a businesslike \nmanner,\n\u2022The time and effort you put into the activity \nindicate you intend to make it profitable,\n\u2022You depend on the income for your liveli-\nhood,\n\u2022Your losses are due to circumstances be-\nyond your control (or are normal in the \nstartup phase of your type of business),\n\u2022You change your methods of operation in \nan attempt to improve profitability,\n\u2022You (or your advisors) have the knowledge \nneeded to carry on the activity as a suc-\ncessful business,\n\u2022You were successful in making a profit in \nsimilar activities in the past,\n\u2022The activity makes a profit in some years, \nand\n\u2022You can expect to make a future profit from \nthe appreciation of the assets used in the \nactivity.\nPresumption of profit.  An activity is pre-\nsumed carried on for profit if it produced a profit \nin at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the \ncurrent year. Activities that consist primarily of \nbreeding, training, showing, or racing horses \nare presumed carried on for profit if they pro-\nduced a profit in at least 2 of the last 7 tax \nyears, including the current year. The activity \nmust be substantially the same for each year \nwithin this period. You have a profit when the \ngross income from an activity exceeds the de-\nductions.\nIf a taxpayer dies before the end of the \n5-year (or 7 -year) period, the \u201ctest\u201d period ends \non the date of the taxpayer's death.\nIf your business or investment activity \npasses this 3 - (or 2 -) years -of-profit test, the \nIRS will presume it is carried on for profit. This \nmeans the limits discussed here will not apply. \nYou can take all your business deductions from \nthe activity, even for the years that you have a \nloss. You can rely on this presumption unless \nthe IRS later shows it to be invalid.\nUsing the presumption later.  If you are start-\ning an activity and do not have 3 (or 2) years \nshowing a profit, you can elect to have the pre-\nsumption made after you have the 5 (or 7) years \nof experience allowed by the test.\nYou can elect to do this by filing Form 5213. \nFiling this form postpones any determination \nthat your activity is not carried on for profit until \n5 (or 7) years have passed since you started \nthe activity.The benefit gained by making this election is \nthat the IRS will not immediately question \nwhether your activity is engaged in for profit. \nAccordingly, it will not restrict your deductions. \nRather, you will gain time to earn a profit in the \nrequired number of years. If you show 3 (or 2) \nyears of profit at the end of this period, your de-\nductions are not limited under these rules. If you \ndo not have 3 (or 2) years of profit, the limit can \nbe applied retroactively to any year with a loss \nin the 5-year (or 7-year) period.\nFiling Form 5213 automatically extends the \nperiod of limitations on any year in the 5 -year \n(or 7 -year) period to 2 years after the due date \nof the tax return for the last year of the period. \nThe period is extended only for deductions of \nthe activity and any related deductions that \nmight be affected.\nYou must file Form 5213 within 3 years \nafter the due date of your tax return \n(determined without extensions) for the \nyear in which you first carried on the activity, or, \nif earlier, within 60 days after receiving written \nnotice from the IRS proposing to disallow de-\nductions attributable to the activity.\nGross Income\nGross income from a not -for-profit activity in-\ncludes the total of all gains from the sale, ex-\nchange, or other disposition of property, and all \nother gross receipts derived from the activity. \nGross income from the activity also includes \ncapital gains and rents received for the use of \nproperty that is held in connection with the ac-\ntivity.\nYou can determine gross income from any \nnot-for- profit activity by subtracting the cost of \ngoods sold from your gross receipts. However, \nif you determine gross income by subtracting \ncost of goods sold from gross receipts, you \nmust do so consistently, and in a manner that \nfollows generally accepted methods of account-\ning.\nLimit on Deductions\nYou can no longer claim any miscella-\nneous itemized deductions. Miscella-\nneous itemized deductions are those \ndeductions that would have been subject to the \n2%-of-adjusted-gross- income limitation. You \ncan still claim certain expenses as itemized de-\nductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).\nDeductions you can take for personal as \nwell as for business activities are allowed in full. \nFor individuals, all nonbusiness deductions, \nsuch as those for home mortgage interest, \ntaxes, and casualty losses, may also be deduc-\nted. Deduct them on the appropriate lines of \nSchedule A (Form 1040).\nFor the limits that apply to home mortgage \ninterest, see Pub. 936.\nGenerally, you can deduct a casualty loss \non property you own for personal use only to \nthe extent each casualty loss is more than \n$100, and the total of all casualty losses ex-\nceeds 10% of your adjusted gross income \n(AGI). See Pub. 547 for more information on \ncasualty losses.\nTIP\nCAUTION!Page 7 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

For more information about the credit \nfor qualified sick and family leave wages, go to \nIRS.gov/PLC .\nThe COVID -19 related employee retention \ncredit has expired.  The employee retention \ncredit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Re-\nlief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and \namended and extended by the Taxpayer Cer-\ntainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was \nlimited to qualified wages paid after March 12, \n2020, and before July 1, 2021.

It must be reasonable.\n\u2022Test 2. It must be for services performed.\nThe form or method of figuring the pay doesn't \naffect its deductibility. For example, bonuses \nand commissions based on sales or earnings, \nand paid under an agreement made before the \nservices were performed, are both deductible.\nTest 1\u2014Reasonableness\nYou must be able to prove that the pay is rea-\nsonable. Whether the pay is reasonable de-\npends on the circumstances that existed when \nyou contracted for the services, not those that \nexist when reasonableness is questioned. If the \npay is excessive, the excess pay is disallowed \nas a deduction.\nFactors to consider.

An award \nisn't an item of tangible personal property if it is \nan award of cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, \ngift coupons, or gift certificates (other than ar-\nrangements granting only the right to select and \nreceive tangible personal property from a limi-\nted assortment of items preselected or preap-\nproved by you). Also, tangible personal prop-\nerty doesn't include vacations, meals, lodging, \ntickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, \nbonds, other securities, and other similar items.\nLength-of- service award.  An award will \nqualify as a length -of-service award only if ei-\nther of the following applies.\n\u2022The employee receives the award after \ntheir first 5 years of employment.\n\u2022The employee didn't receive another \nlength-of-service award (other than one of \nvery small value) during the same year or \nin any of the prior 4 years.\nSafety achievement award.  An award for \nsafety achievement will qualify as an achieve-\nment award unless one of the following applies.\n1.It is given to a manager, administrator, \nclerical employee, or other professional \nemployee.\n2.During the tax year, more than 10% of \nyour employees, excluding those listed in \n(1), have already received a safety ach-\nievement award (other than one of very \nsmall value).\nDeduction limit.  Your deduction for the \ncost of employee achievement awards given to \nany one employee during the tax year is limited \nto the following.\n\u2022$400 for awards that aren't qualified plan \nawards.\n\u2022$1,600 for all awards, whether or not quali-\nfied plan awards.\nA qualified plan award is an achievement \naward given as part of an established written \nplan or program that doesn't favor highly com-\npensated employees as to eligibility or benefits.\nA highly compensated employee is an em-\nployee who meets either of the following tests.\n1.The employee was a 5% owner at any \ntime during the year or the preceding year.\n2.The employee received more than \n$130,000 in pay for the preceding year.\nYou can choose to ignore test (2) if the em-\nployee wasn't also in the top 20% of employees \nwhen ranked by pay for the preceding year.\nAn award isn't a qualified plan award if the \naverage cost of all the employee achievement \nawards given during the tax year (that would be \nqualified plan awards except for this limit) is \nmore than $400. To figure this average cost, ig-\nnore awards of nominal value.\nDeduct achievement awards, up to the max-\nimum amounts listed earlier, as a nonwage \nbusiness expense on your return or business \nschedule.You may not owe employment taxes on \nthe value of some achievement awards \nyou provide to an employee. See Pub. \n15-B.\nBonuses\nYou can generally deduct a bonus paid to an \nemployee if you intended the bonus as addi-\ntional pay for services, not as a gift, and the \nservices were performed. However, the total \nbonuses, salaries, and other pay must be rea-\nsonable for the services performed. If the bonus \nis paid in property, see Property , later.\nGifts of nominal value.  If, to promote em-\nployee goodwill, you distribute merchandise of \nnominal value or other de minimis items to your \nemployees at holidays, you can deduct the cost \nof these items as a nonwage business ex-\npense. See Pub. 15 -B for additional information \non de minimis fringe benefits. If you provide \nfood to your employees, your business deduc-\ntion may be limited; see Meals and lodging , \nlater.\nEducation Expenses\nIf you pay or reimburse education expenses for \nan employee, you can deduct the payments if \nthey are part of a qualified educational assis-\ntance program. Deduct them on the \u201cEmployee \nbenefit programs\u201d or other appropriate line of \nyour tax return. For information on educational \nassistance programs, see Educational Assis-\ntance  in section 2 of Pub. 15-B.\nSection 2206 of the CARES Act ex-\npands the definition of educational as-\nsistance to include certain employer \npayments of student loans paid after March 27, \n2020. The exclusion applies to the payment by \nan employer, whether paid to the employee or \nto a lender, of principal or interest on any quali-\nfied education loan incurred by the employee \nfor the education of the employee. Qualified ed-\nucation loans are defined in chapter 10 of Pub. \n970. This exclusion expires January 1, 2026, \nunless extended by future legislation.\nFringe Benefits\nA fringe benefit is a form of pay for the perform-\nance of services. You can generally deduct the \ncost of fringe benefits.\nYou may be able to exclude all or part of the \nvalue of some fringe benefits from your employ-\nees' pay. You also may not owe employment \ntaxes on the value of the fringe benefits. See \nTable 2-1 in Pub. 15-B for details.\nGenerally, no deduction is allowed for activi-\nties generally considered entertainment, \namusement, or recreation, or for a facility used \nin connection with such activity. However, you \nmay deduct these expenses if the goods, serv-\nices, or facilities are treated as compensation to \nthe recipient and reported on Form W -2 for an \nemployee or on Form 1099 -NEC for an inde-\npendent contractor. If the recipient is an officer, \ndirector, beneficial owner (directly or indirectly), \nor other \u201cspecified individual\u201d (as defined in \nTIP\nTIPPage 9 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

See section \n274(e)(2) and Regulations sections 1.274-9 and \n1.274-10.\nCertain fringe benefits are discussed next. \nSee Pub. 15 -B for more details on these and \nother fringe benefits.\nMeals and lodging.  Generally, you can de-\nduct 50% of certain meal expenses and 100% \nof certain lodging expenses provided to your \nemployees. If the amounts are deductible, de-\nduct the cost in whatever category the expense \nfalls.\nDeduction limit on meals.  You can gen-\nerally deduct only 50% of the cost of furnishing \nmeals to your employees. However, you can \ndeduct the full cost of certain meals; see sec-\ntion 274(n)(2) and Regulations section \n1.274- 12(c) for more information. For example, \nyou can deduct the full cost of the following \nmeals.\n\u2022Meals whose value you include in an em-\nployee's wages.\n\u2022Meals you furnish to your employees as \npart of the expense of providing recrea-\ntional or social activities, such as holiday \nparties or annual picnics, when made pri-\nmarily for the benefit of your employees \nother than employees who are officers, \nshareholders or other owners who own a \n10% or greater interest in your business, or \nother highly compensated employees.\n\u2022Meals you furnish to your employees at the \nwork site when you operate a restaurant or \ncatering service.\n\u2022Meals you\u2019re required by federal law to fur-\nnish to crew members of certain commer-\ncial vessels (or would be required to fur-\nnish if the vessels were operated at sea). \nThis doesn't include meals you furnish on \nvessels primarily providing luxury water \ntransportation.\n\u2022Meals you furnish on an oil or gas platform \nor drilling rig located offshore or in Alaska. \nThis includes meals you furnish at a sup-\nport camp that is near and integral to an oil \nor gas drilling rig located in Alaska.\nP.L. 115 -97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, \nchanged the rules for the deduction of \nfood or beverage expenses that are ex-\ncludable from employee income as a de mini-\nmis fringe benefit. For amounts incurred or paid \nafter 2017, the 50% limit on deductions for food \nor beverage expenses also applies to food or \nbeverage expenses excludable from employee \nincome as a de minimis fringe benefit. While \nyour business deduction may be limited, the \nrules that allow you to exclude certain de mini-\nmis meals and meals on your business prem-\nises from your employee's wages still apply. \nSee Meals  in section 2 of Pub. 15-B.\nFood and beverage expense incurred to-\ngether with entertainment expenses.  P.L. \n115- 97 changed the rules for the deduction of \nbusiness entertainment expenses. For amounts \nincurred or paid after 2017, no business deduc-\ntion is allowed for any item generally consid-\nered to be entertainment, amusement, or recre-\nation. As discussed earlier, you can deduct \n50% of the cost of business meals. If food and \nCAUTION!beverages are provided during or at an enter-\ntainment activity, and the food and beverages \nare purchased separately from the entertain-\nment, or the cost of the food and beverages is \nstated separately from the cost of the entertain-\nment on one or more bills, invoices, or receipts, \nyou may continue to deduct 50% of the busi-\nness meal expenses. The amount charged for \nfood or beverages on a bill, invoice, or receipt \nmust reflect the venue's usual selling cost for \nthose items if they were to be purchased sepa-\nrately from the entertainment or must approxi-\nmate the reasonable value of those items. If you \npurchase food and beverages together with en-\ntertainment expenses and the cost of the food \nand beverages isn't stated separately on the in-\nvoice, the cost of the food and beverages is \nalso an entertainment expense and none of the \nexpenses are deductible. For more information, \nincluding details about additional requirements \nthat must be met for a business meal to be de-\nductible, see Regulations sections 1. 274-11 \nand 1.274-12(a).\nSection 210 of the Taxpayer Certainty \nand Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 \nprovides for the temporary allowance \nof a 100% business meal deduction for food or \nbeverages provided by a restaurant and paid or \nincurred after December 31, 2020, and before \nJanuary 1, 2023. For more information, see No-\ntice 2021 -25, 2021 -17 I.R.B. 1118, available at \nIRS.gov/irb/2021-17_IRB#NOT-2021-25 ; and \nNotice 2021 -63, 2021 -49 I.R.B. 835, available \nat IRS.gov/irb/2021-49_IRB#NOT-2021-63 .\nTransportation (commuting) benefits.  If \nyou provide your employees with qualified \ntransportation benefits, such as transportation \nin a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, \nor qualified parking, you may no longer deduct \nthese amounts. P.L. 115 -97 provides that no \ndeduction is allowed for qualified transportation \nbenefits (whether provided directly by you, \nthrough a bona fide reimbursement arrange-\nment, or through a compensation reduction \nagreement) incurred or paid after 2017. Also, \nno deduction is allowed for any expense incur-\nred for providing any transportation, or any pay-\nment or reimbursement to your employee, in \nconnection with travel between your employee's \nresidence and place of employment, except as \nnecessary for ensuring the safety of your em-\nployee or for qualified bicycle commuting reim-\nbursements as described in section 132(f)(5)\n(F). While you may no longer deduct payments \nfor qualified transportation benefits, the fringe \nbenefit exclusion rules still apply and the pay-\nments, except for qualified bicycle commuting \nreimbursements, may be excluded from your \nemployee's wages. Although the value of a \nqualified transportation fringe benefit is relevant \nin determining the fringe benefit exclusion and \nwhether the section 274(e)(2) exception for ex-\npenses treated as compensation applies, the \ndeduction that is disallowed relates to the ex-\npense of providing a qualified transportation \nfringe, not its value. For more information, see \nRegulations sections 1. 274- 13 and 1. 274-14. \nSee Pub. 15- B for more information about quali-\nfied transportation benefits.\nTIPEmployee benefit programs.  Employee ben-\nefit programs include the following.\n\u2022Accident and health plans.\n\u2022Adoption assistance.\n\u2022Cafeteria plans.\n\u2022Dependent care assistance.\n\u2022Education assistance.\n\u2022Life insurance coverage.\n\u2022Welfare benefit funds.\nYou can generally deduct amounts you \nspend on employee benefit programs on the \napplicable line of your tax return. For example, \nif you provide dependent care by operating a \ndependent care facility for your employees, de-\nduct your costs in whatever categories they fall \n(utilities, salaries, etc.).\nLife insurance coverage.  You can't de-\nduct the cost of life insurance coverage for you, \nan employee, or any person with a financial in-\nterest in your business if you\u2019re directly or indi-\nrectly the beneficiary of the policy. See Regula-\ntions section 1.264-1 for more information.\nWelfare benefit funds.  A welfare benefit \nfund is a funded plan (or a funded arrangement \nhaving the effect of a plan) that provides welfare \nbenefits to your employees, independent con-\ntractors, or their beneficiaries. Welfare benefits \nare any benefits other than deferred compensa-\ntion or transfers of restricted property.\nYour deduction for contributions to a welfare \nbenefit fund is limited to the fund's qualified cost \nfor the tax year. If your contributions to the fund \nare more than its qualified cost, carry the ex-\ncess over to the next tax year.\nGenerally, the fund's \u201cqualified cost\u201d is the \ntotal of the following amounts, reduced by the \nafter-tax income of the fund.\n\u2022The cost you would\u2019ve been able to deduct \nusing the cash method of accounting if you \nhad paid for the benefits directly.\n\u2022The contributions added to a reserve ac-\ncount that are needed to fund claims incur-\nred but not paid as of the end of the year. \nThese claims can be for supplemental un-\nemployment benefits, severance pay, or \ndisability, medical, or life insurance bene-\nfits.\nFor more information, see sections 419(c) \nand 419A and the related regulations.\nLoans or Advances\nYou can generally deduct as wages an advance \nyou make to an employee for services to be \nperformed if you don't expect the employee to \nrepay the advance. However, if the employee \nperforms no services, treat the amount you ad-\nvanced as a loan; if the employee doesn't repay \nthe loan, treat it as income to the employee.\nBelow- market interest rate loans.  On cer-\ntain loans you make to an employee or share-\nholder, you\u2019re treated as having received inter-\nest income and as having paid compensation or \ndividends equal to that interest.

        "content": "Property\nIf you transfer property (including your compa-\nny's stock) to an employee as payment for serv-\nices, you can generally deduct it as wages. The \namount you can deduct is the property's fair \nmarket value (FMV) on the date of the transfer \nless any amount the employee paid for the \nproperty.\nYou can claim the deduction only for the tax \nyear in which your employee includes the prop-\nerty's value in their income. Your employee is \ndeemed to have included the value in their in-\ncome if you report it on their Form W -2 in a \ntimely manner.\nYou treat the deductible amount as received \nin exchange for the property, and you must rec-\nognize any gain or loss realized on the transfer, \nunless it is the company's stock transferred as \npayment for services. Your gain or loss is the \ndifference between the FMV of the property and \nits adjusted basis on the date of transfer.\nThese rules also apply to property transfer-\nred to an independent contractor for services, \ngenerally reported on Form 1099-NEC.\nRestricted property.  If the property you \ntransfer for services is subject to restrictions \nthat affect its value, you generally can't deduct it \nand don't report gain or loss until it is substan-\ntially vested in the recipient. However, if the re-\ncipient pays for the property, you must report \nany gain at the time of the transfer up to the \namount paid.\n\u201cSubstantially vested\u201d means the property \nisn't subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. \nThis means that the recipient isn't likely to have \nto give up their rights in the property in the fu-\nture.\nReimbursements for \nBusiness Expenses\nYou can generally deduct the amount you pay \nor reimburse employees for business expenses \nincurred for your business. However, your de-\nduction may be limited.\nIf you make the payment under an account-\nable plan, deduct it in the category of the ex-\npense paid. For example, if you pay an em-\nployee for travel expenses incurred on your \nbehalf, deduct this payment as a travel ex-\npense. If you make the payment under a nonac-\ncountable plan, deduct it as wages and include \nit on the employee's Form W-2.\nSee Reimbursement of Travel and Non -En-\ntertainment Related Meals  in chapter 11  for \nmore information about deducting reimburse-\nments and an explanation of accountable and \nnonaccountable plans.\nSick and Vacation Pay\nSick pay.  You can deduct amounts you pay to \nyour employees for sickness and injury, includ-\ning lump -sum amounts, as wages. However, \nyour deduction is limited to amounts not com-\npensated by insurance or other means.\nVacation pay.  Vacation pay is an employee \nbenefit. It includes amounts paid for unused va-cation leave. You can deduct vacation pay only \nin the tax year in which the employee actually \nreceives it. This rule applies regardless of \nwhether you use the cash or accrual method of \naccounting.\n3.\nRent Expense\nIntroduction\nThis chapter discusses the tax treatment of rent \nor lease payments you make for property you \nuse in your business but do not own. It also dis-\ncusses how to treat other kinds of payments \nyou make that are related to your use of this \nproperty. These include payments you make for \ntaxes on the property.\nTopics\nThis chapter discusses:\n\u2022The definition of rent\n\u2022Taxes on leased property\n\u2022The cost of getting a lease\n\u2022Improvements by the lessee\n\u2022Capitalizing rent expenses\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\nPublication\n538 Accounting Periods and Methods\n544 Sales and Other Dispositions of \nAssets\n946 How To Depreciate Property\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nRent\nRent is any amount you pay for the use of prop-\nerty you do not own. In general, you can deduct \nrent as an expense only if the rent is for prop-\nerty you use in your trade or business. If you \nhave or will receive equity in or title to the prop-\nerty, the rent is not deductible.\nUnreasonable rent.  You can\u2019t take a rental \ndeduction for unreasonable rent. Ordinarily, the \nissue of reasonableness arises only if you and \nthe lessor are related. Rent paid to a related \nperson is reasonable if it is the same amount \nyou would pay to a stranger for use of the same \nproperty. Rent isn\u2019t unreasonable just because \nit is figured as a percentage of gross sales. For \nexamples of related persons, see Related per-\nsons  in chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\nRent on your home.  If you rent your home \nand use part of it as your place of business, you   538 \n  544 \n  946 may be able to deduct the rent you pay for that \npart. You must meet the requirements for busi-\nness use of your home. For more information, \nsee Business use of your home  in chapter 1 .\nRent paid in advance.  Generally, rent paid for \nuse of property in your trade or business is de-\nductible in the year paid or incurred. If you are \nan accrual method taxpayer and pay rent in ad-\nvance, you can deduct only the amount of rent \nthat applies to your use of rented property dur-\ning the tax year. You can deduct the rest of the \nrent payment only over the period to which it \napplies. If you are a cash method taxpayer, you \nmay deduct the entire amount of rent you paid \nin advance in the year of payment if the pay-\nment applies to the right to use property that \ndoes not extend beyond the earlier of 12 \nmonths after the first date you have the right to \nuse the property or the end of the tax year fol-\nlowing the year in which you paid the advance \nrent. If your payment applies to the right to use \nproperty beyond this period, then you must cap-\nitalize the rent payment and deduct it over the \nperiod to which it applies.\nExample 1.  You are an accrual method \ncalendar year taxpayer and you lease a building \nat a monthly rental rate of $1,000 beginning \nJuly 1, 2022. On June 30, 2022, you pay ad-\nvance rent of $12,000 for the last 6 months of \n2022 and the first 6 months of 2023. You can \ndeduct only $6,000 for 2022, for the right to use \nproperty in 2022. You deduct the other $6,000 \nin 2023.\nExample 2.  Assume the same facts as Ex-\nample 1 , except you are a cash method calen-\ndar year taxpayer. You may deduct the entire \n$12,000 payment for 2022. The payment ap-\nplies to your right to use the property that does \nnot extend beyond 12 months after the date you \nreceived this right. If you deduct the $12,000 in \n2022, you should not deduct any part of this \npayment in 2023.\nExample 3.  You are either a cash or ac-\ncrual calendar year taxpayer. Last January, you \nleased property for 3 years for $6,000 per year. \nYou pay the full $18,000 (3 x $6,000) during the \nfirst year of the lease. Because this amount is a \nprepaid expense that must be capitalized, you \ncan deduct only $6,000 per year, the amount al-\nlocable to your use of the property in each year.\nCanceling a lease.  You can generally deduct \nas rent an amount you pay to cancel a business \nlease.\nLease or purchase.  There may be instances \nin which you must determine whether your pay-\nments are for rent or for the purchase of the \nproperty. You must first determine whether your \nagreement is a lease or a conditional sales con-\ntract. Payments made under a conditional sales \ncontract are not deductible as rent expense.\nConditional sales contract.  Whether an \nagreement is a conditional sales contract de-\npends on the intent of the parties. Determine in-\ntent based on the provisions of the agreement \nand the facts and circumstances that exist \nwhen you make the agreement. No single test, \nor special combination of tests, always applies. \nHowever, in general, an agreement may be Page 11 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Determine this value when you make \nthe agreement.\n\u2022You have an option to buy the property at a \nnominal price compared to the total \namount you have to pay under the agree-\nment.\n\u2022The agreement designates part of the pay-\nments as interest, or that part is easy to \nrecognize as interest.\nLeveraged leases.  Leveraged lease trans-\nactions may not be considered leases. Lever-\naged leases generally involve three parties: a \nlessor, a lessee, and a lender to the lessor. \nUsually, the lease term covers a large part of \nthe useful life of the leased property, and the \nlessee's payments to the lessor are enough to \ncover the lessor's payments to the lender.\nIf you plan to take part in what appears to be \na leveraged lease, you may want to get an ad-\nvance ruling.\n\u2022Revenue Procedure 2001-28 contains the \nguidelines the IRS will use to determine if a \nleveraged lease is a lease for federal in-\ncome tax purposes.\n\u2022Revenue Procedure 2001-29 provides the \ninformation required to be furnished in a \nrequest for an advance ruling on a lever-\naged lease transaction.\nThese two revenue procedures can be found in \nI.R.B. 2001 -19, which is available at \nIRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb01-19.pdf .\nFor advance ruling purposes only, the IRS \nwill consider the lessor in a leveraged lease \ntransaction to be the owner of the property and \nthe transaction to be a valid lease if all the fac-\ntors in the revenue procedure are met, including \nthe following.\n\u2022The lessor must maintain a minimum un-\nconditional \u201cat risk\u201d equity investment in \nthe property (at least 20% of the cost of the \nproperty) during the entire lease term.\n\u2022The lessee may not have a contractual \nright to buy the property from the lessor at \nless than FMV when the right is exercised.\n\u2022The lessee may not invest in the property, \nexcept as provided by Revenue Procedure \n2001-28.\n\u2022The lessee may not lend any money to the \nlessor to buy the property or guarantee the \nloan used by the lessor to buy the prop-\nerty.\n\u2022The lessor must show that it expects to re-\nceive a profit apart from the tax deduc-\ntions, allowances, credits, and other tax at-\ntributes.The IRS may charge you a user fee for issu-\ning a tax ruling. For more information, see Rev-\nenue Procedure 2022-1, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/2022-01_IRB#REV-PROC-2022-1 .\nLeveraged leases of limited -use prop-\nerty.  The IRS won\u2019t issue advance rulings on \nleveraged leases of so -called limited -use prop-\nerty. Limited -use property is property not ex-\npected to be either useful to or usable by a les-\nsor at the end of the lease term except for \ncontinued leasing or transfer to a lessee. See \nRevenue Procedure 2001 -28 for examples of \nlimited- use property and property that isn\u2019t limi-\nted-use property.\nLeases over $250,000.  Special rules are pro-\nvided for certain leases of tangible property. \nThe rules apply if the lease calls for total pay-\nments of more than $250,000 and any of the fol-\nlowing apply.\n\u2022Rents increase during the lease.\n\u2022Rents decrease during the lease.\n\u2022Rents are deferred (rent is payable after \nthe end of the calendar year following the \ncalendar year in which the use occurs and \nthe rent is allocated).\n\u2022Rents are prepaid (rent is payable before \nthe end of the calendar year preceding the \ncalendar year in which the use occurs and \nthe rent is allocated).\nThese rules do not apply if your lease specifies \nequal amounts of rent for each month in the \nlease term and all rent payments are due in the \ncalendar year to which the rent relates (or in the \npreceding or following calendar year).\nGenerally, if the special rules apply, you \nmust use an accrual method of accounting (and \ntime value of money principles) for your rental \nexpenses, regardless of your overall method of \naccounting. In addition, in certain cases in \nwhich the IRS has determined that a lease was \ndesigned to achieve tax avoidance, you must \ntake rent and stated or imputed interest into ac-\ncount under a constant rental accrual method in \nwhich the rent is treated as accruing ratably \nover the entire lease term. For details, see sec-\ntion 467.\nTaxes on\nLeased Property\nIf you lease business property, you can deduct \nas additional rent any taxes you have to pay to \nor for the lessor. When you can deduct these \ntaxes as additional rent depends on your ac-\ncounting method.\nCash method.  If you use the cash method of \naccounting, you can deduct the taxes as addi-\ntional rent only for the tax year in which you pay \nthem.\nAccrual method.  If you use an accrual \nmethod of accounting, you can deduct the \ntaxes as additional rent for the tax year in which \nyou can determine all the following.\n\u2022That you have a liability for taxes on the \nleased property.\n\u2022How much the liability is.\n\u2022That economic performance occurred.The liability and amount of taxes are deter-\nmined by state or local law and the lease agree-\nment. Economic performance occurs as you \nuse the property.\nExample 1.  Oak Corporation is a calendar \nyear taxpayer that uses an accrual method of \naccounting. Oak leases land for use in its busi-\nness. Under state law, owners of real property \nbecome liable (incur a lien on the property) for \nreal estate taxes for the year on January 1 of \nthat year. However, they don\u2019t have to pay \nthese taxes until July 1 of the next year (18 \nmonths later) when tax bills are issued. Under \nthe terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for \nthe real estate taxes in the later year when the \ntax bills are issued. If the lease ends before the \ntax bill for a year is issued, Oak isn\u2019t liable for \nthe taxes for that year.\nOak cannot deduct the real estate taxes as \nrent until the tax bill is issued. This is when \nOak's liability under the lease becomes fixed.\nExample 2.  The facts are the same as in \nExample 1 , except that, according to the terms \nof the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real es-\ntate taxes when the owner of the property be-\ncomes liable for them. As a result, Oak will de-\nduct the real estate taxes as rent on its tax \nreturn for the earlier year. This is the year in \nwhich Oak's liability under the lease becomes \nfixed.\nCost of Getting a Lease\nYou may either enter into a new lease with the \nlessor of the property or get an existing lease \nfrom another lessee. Very often when you get \nan existing lease from another lessee, you must \npay the previous lessee money to get the lease, \nbesides having to pay the rent on the lease.\nIf you get an existing lease on property or \nequipment for your business, you must gener-\nally amortize any amount you pay to get that \nlease over the remaining term of the lease. For \nexample, if you pay $10,000 to get a lease and \nthere are 10 years remaining on the lease with \nno option to renew, you can deduct $1,000 \neach year.\nThe cost of getting an existing lease of tan-\ngible property is not subject to the amortization \nrules for section 197 intangibles discussed in \nchapter 8 .\nOption to renew.  The term of the lease for \namortization includes all renewal options plus \nany other period for which you and the lessor \nreasonably expect the lease to be renewed. \nHowever, this applies only if less than 75% of \nthe cost of getting the lease is for the term re-\nmaining on the purchase date (not including \nany period for which you may choose to renew, \nextend, or continue the lease). Allocate the \nlease cost to the original term and any option \nterm based on the facts and circumstances. In \nsome cases, it may be appropriate to make the \nallocation using a present value calculation.

        "content": "Example 1.  You paid $10,000 to get a \nlease with 20 years remaining on it and two op-\ntions to renew for 5 years each. Of this cost, \nyou paid $7,000 for the original lease and \n$3,000 for the renewal options. Because \n$7,000 is less than 75% of the total $10,000 \ncost of the lease (or $7,500), you must amortize \nthe $10,000 over 30 years. That is the remain-\ning life of your present lease plus the periods for \nrenewal.\nExample 2.  The facts are the same as in \nExample 1 , except that you paid $8,000 for the \noriginal lease and $2,000 for the renewal op-\ntions. You can amortize the entire $10,000 over \nthe 20 -year remaining life of the original lease. \nThe $8,000 cost of getting the original lease \nwas not less than 75% of the total cost of the \nlease (or $7,500).\nCost of a modification agreement.  You may \nhave to pay an additional \u201crent\u201d amount over \npart of the lease period to change certain provi-\nsions in your lease. You must capitalize these \npayments and amortize them over the remain-\ning period of the lease. You can\u2019t deduct the \npayments as additional rent, even if they are \ndescribed as rent in the agreement.\nExample.  You are a calendar year tax-\npayer and sign a 20 -year lease to rent part of a \nbuilding starting on January 1. However, before \nyou occupy it, you decide that you really need \nless space. The lessor agrees to reduce your \nrent from $7,000 to $6,000 per year and to re-\nlease the excess space from the original lease. \nIn exchange, you agree to pay an additional \nrent amount of $3,000, payable in 60 monthly \ninstallments of $50 each.\nYou must capitalize the $3,000 and amortize \nit over the 20- year term of the lease. Your amor-\ntization deduction each year will be $150 \n($3,000 \u00f7 20). You can\u2019t deduct the $600 (12 \u00d7 \n$50) that you will pay during each of the first 5 \nyears as rent.\nCommissions, bonuses, and fees.  Commis-\nsions, bonuses, fees, and other amounts you \npay to get a lease on property you use in your \nbusiness are capital costs. You must amortize \nthese costs over the term of the lease.\nLoss on merchandise and fixtures.  If you \nsell at a loss merchandise and fixtures that you \nbought solely to get a lease, the loss is a cost of \ngetting the lease. You must capitalize the loss \nand amortize it over the remaining term of the \nlease.\nImprovements\nby Lessee\nIf you add buildings or make other permanent \nimprovements to leased property, depreciate \nthe cost of the improvements using the modified \naccelerated cost recovery system (MACRS). \nDepreciate the property over its appropriate re-\ncovery period. You can\u2019t amortize the cost over \nthe remaining term of the lease.\nIf you don\u2019t keep the improvements when \nyou end the lease, figure your gain or loss based on your adjusted basis in the improve-\nments at that time.\nFor more information, see the discussion of \nMACRS in chapter 4 of Pub. 946.\nAssignment of a lease.  If a long -term lessee \nwho makes permanent improvements to land \nlater assigns all lease rights to you for money \nand you pay the rent required by the lease, the \namount you pay for the assignment is a capital \ninvestment. If the rental value of the leased land \nincreased since the lease began, part of your \ncapital investment is for that increase in the \nrental value. The rest is for your investment in \nthe permanent improvements.\nThe part that is for the increased rental value \nof the land is a cost of getting a lease, and you \namortize it over the remaining term of the lease. \nYou can depreciate the part that is for your in-\nvestment in the improvements over the recov-\nery period of the property as discussed earlier, \nwithout regard to the lease term.\nCapitalizing\nRent Expenses\nUnder the uniform capitalization rules, you must \ncapitalize the direct costs and part of the indi-\nrect costs for certain production or resale activi-\nties. Include these costs in the basis of property \nyou produce or acquire for resale, rather than \nclaiming them as a current deduction. You re-\ncover the costs through depreciation, amortiza-\ntion, or cost of goods sold when you use, sell, \nor otherwise dispose of the property.\nIndirect costs include amounts incurred for \nrenting or leasing equipment, facilities, or land.\nUniform capitalization rules.  You may be \nsubject to the uniform capitalization rules if you \ndo any of the following, unless the property is \nproduced for your use other than in a business \nor an activity carried on for profit.\n1.Produce real property or tangible personal \nproperty.\n2.Acquire property for resale. However, this \nrule does not apply to personal property if \nyour average annual gross receipts are \n$27 million or less.\nEffective for tax years beginning after 2017, \nif you are a small business taxpayer (see Cost \nof Goods Sold  in chapter 1), you are not re-\nquired to capitalize costs under section 263A. \nSee section 263A(i).\nProducing property.  You produce prop-\nerty if you construct, build, install, manufacture, \ndevelop, improve, create, raise, or grow the \nproperty. Property produced for you under a \ncontract is treated as produced by you to the \nextent you make payments or otherwise incur \ncosts in connection with the property.\nExample 1.  You rent construction equip-\nment to build a storage facility. If you are sub-\nject to the uniform capitalization rules, you must \ncapitalize as part of the cost of the building the \nrent you paid for the equipment. You recover \nyour cost by claiming a deduction for \ndepreciation on the building.Example 2.  You rent space in a facility to \nconduct your business of manufacturing tools. If \nyou are subject to the uniform capitalization \nrules, you must include the rent you paid to oc-\ncupy the facility in the cost of the tools you pro-\nduce.\nMore information.

        "content": "8990 Limitation on Business Interest \nExpense Under Section 163(j)\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nAllocation of Interest\nThe rules for deducting interest vary, depending \non whether the loan proceeds are used for busi-\nness, personal, or investment activities. If you \nuse the proceeds of a loan for more than one \ntype of expense, you must allocate the interest \nbased on the use of the loan's proceeds.\nAllocate your interest expense to the follow-\ning categories.\n\u2022Nonpassive trade or business activity inter-\nest.\n\u2022Passive trade or business activity interest.\n\u2022Investment interest.\n\u2022Portfolio interest.\n\u2022Personal interest.\nIn general, you allocate interest on a loan the \nsame way you allocate the loan proceeds. You \nallocate loan proceeds by tracing disburse-\nments to specific uses.\nThe easiest way to trace disburse-\nments to specific uses is to keep the \nproceeds of a particular loan separate \nfrom any other funds.\nSecured loan. The allocation of loan proceeds \nand the related interest is generally not affected \nby the use of property that secures the loan.\nExample. Marge and Jeff secure a loan \nwith property used in their business. They use \nthe loan proceeds to buy an automobile for per-\nsonal use. Jeff and Marge must allocate interest \nexpense on the loan to personal use (purchase \nof the automobile) even though the loan is se-\ncured by business property.\nP.L. 115 -97, section 11043, limited the \ndeduction for mortgage interest paid on \nhome equity loans and line of credit. \nFor more information, see Pub. 936.\nAllocation period. The period for which a loan \nis allocated to a particular use begins on the \ndate the proceeds are used and ends on the \nearlier of the following dates.\n\u2022The date the loan is repaid.\n\u2022The date the loan is reallocated to another \nuse.\nProceeds not disbursed to borrower.  Even \nif the lender disburses the loan proceeds to a \nthird party, the allocation of the loan is still \nbased on your use of the funds. This applies \nwhether you pay for property, services, or any-\nthing else by incurring a loan, or you take prop-\nerty subject to a debt.\nProceeds deposited in borrower's account. \nTreat loan proceeds deposited in an account as \nproperty held for investment. It does not matter \nwhether the account pays interest. Any interest \nyou pay on the loan is investment interest ex-\npense. If you withdraw the proceeds of the loan, \nyou must reallocate the loan based on the use \nof the funds.  8990\nTIP\nCAUTION! Example. Celina, a calendar-year taxpayer, \nborrows $100,000 on January 4 and immedi-\nately uses the proceeds to open a checking ac-\ncount. No other amounts are deposited in the \naccount during the year and no part of the loan \nprincipal is repaid during the year. On April 2, \nCelina uses $20,000 from the checking account \nfor a passive activity expenditure. On Septem-\nber 4, Celina uses an additional $40,000 from \nthe account for personal purposes.\nUnder the interest allocation rules, the entire \n$100,000 loan is treated as property held for in-\nvestment for the period from January 4 through \nApril 1. From April 2 through September 3, Cel-\nina must treat $20,000 of the loan as used in the \npassive activity and $80,000 of the loan as \nproperty held for investment. From September \n4 through December 31, she must treat \n$40,000 of the loan as used for personal purpo-\nses, $20,000 as used in the passive activity, \nand $40,000 as property held for investment.\nOrder of funds spent.  Generally, you treat \nloan proceeds deposited in an account as used \n(spent) before either of the following amounts.\n\u2022Any unborrowed amounts held in the same \naccount.\n\u2022Any amounts deposited after these loan \nproceeds.\nExample. On January 9, Olena opened a \nchecking account, depositing $500 of the pro-\nceeds of Loan A and $1,000 of unborrowed \nfunds. The following table shows the transac-\ntions in her account during the tax year.\nDate Transaction\nJanuary 9 $500 proceeds of Loan A and \n$1,000 unborrowed funds \ndeposited\nJanuary 14 $500 proceeds of Loan B \ndeposited\nFebruary 19 $800 used for personal purposes\nFebruary 27 $700 used for passive activity\nJune 19 $1,000 proceeds of Loan C \ndeposited\nNovember 20 $800 used for an investment\nDecember 18 $600 used for personal purposes\nOlena treats the $800 used for personal pur-\nposes as made from the $500 proceeds of Loan \nA and $300 of the proceeds of Loan B. She \ntreats the $700 used for a passive activity as \nmade from the remaining $200 proceeds of \nLoan B and $500 of unborrowed funds. She \ntreats the $800 used for an investment as made \nentirely from the proceeds of Loan C. She treats \nthe $600 used for personal purposes as made \nfrom the remaining $200 proceeds of Loan C \nand $400 of unborrowed funds.\nFor the periods during which loan proceeds \nare held in the account, Olena treats them as \nproperty held for investment.\nPayments from checking accounts. \nGenerally, you treat a payment from a checking \nor similar account as made at the time the \ncheck is written if you mail or deliver it to the \npayee within a reasonable period after you write \nit. You can treat checks written on the same day \nas written in any order.Amounts paid within 30 days.  If you re-\nceive loan proceeds in cash or if the loan pro-\nceeds are deposited in an account, you can \ntreat any payment (up to the amount of the pro-\nceeds) made from any account you own, or \nfrom cash, as made from those proceeds. This \napplies to any payment made within 30 days \nbefore or after the proceeds are received in \ncash or deposited in your account.\nIf the loan proceeds are deposited in an ac-\ncount, you can apply this rule even if the rules \nstated earlier under Order of funds spent  would \notherwise require you to treat the proceeds as \nused for other purposes. If you apply this rule to \nany payments, disregard those payments (and \nthe proceeds from which they are made) when \napplying the rules stated earlier under Order of \nfunds spent .\nIf you received the loan proceeds in cash, \nyou can treat the payment as made on the date \nyou received the cash instead of the date you \nactually made the payment.\nExample. Giovanni gets a loan of $1,000 \non August 4 and receives the proceeds in cash. \nGiovanni deposits $1,500 in an account on Au-\ngust 8 and on August 18 writes a check on the \naccount for a passive activity expense. Also, \nGiovanni deposits his paycheck, deposits other \nloan proceeds, and pays his bills during the \nsame period. Regardless of these other trans-\nactions, Giovanni can treat $1,000 of the de-\nposit he made on August 8 as being paid on Au-\ngust 4 from the loan proceeds. In addition, \nGiovanni can treat the passive activity expense \nhe paid on August 18 as made from the $1,000 \nloan proceeds treated as deposited in the ac-\ncount.\nOptional method for determining date of \nreallocation. You can use the following \nmethod to determine the date loan proceeds \nare reallocated to another use. You can treat all \npayments from loan proceeds in the account \nduring any month as taking place on the later of \nthe following dates.\n\u2022The first day of that month.\n\u2022The date the loan proceeds are deposited \nin the account.\nHowever, you can use this optional method only \nif you treat all payments from the account dur-\ning the same calendar month in the same way.\nInterest on a segregated account.  If you \nhave an account that contains only loan pro-\nceeds and interest earned on the account, you \ncan treat any payment from that account as be-\ning made first from the interest. When the inter-\nest earned is used up, any remaining payments \nare from loan proceeds.\nExample. You borrowed $20,000 and used \nthe proceeds of this loan to open a new savings \naccount. When the account had earned interest \nof $867, you withdrew $20,000 for personal pur-\nposes. You can treat the withdrawal as coming \nfirst from the interest earned on the account, \n$867, and then from the loan proceeds, \n$19,133 ($20,000 \u2212 $867). All the interest \ncharged on the loan from the time it was depos-\nited in the account until the time of the with-\ndrawal is investment interest expense. The in-\nterest charged on the part of the proceeds used \nfor personal purposes ($19,133) from the time Page 14 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

The interest charged on the loan pro-\nceeds you left in the account ($867) continues \nto be investment interest expense until you ei-\nther repay it or reallocate it to another use.\nLoan repayment.  When you repay any part of \na loan allocated to more than one use, treat it as \nbeing repaid in the following order.\n1.Personal use.\n2.Investments and passive activities (other \nthan those included in (3)).\n3.Passive activities in connection with a \nrental real estate activity in which you ac-\ntively participate.\n4.Former passive activities.\n5.Trade or business use and expenses for \ncertain low-income housing projects.\nLine of credit (continuous borrowings). The \nfollowing rules apply if you have a line of credit \nor similar arrangement.\n1.Treat all borrowed funds on which interest \naccrues at the same fixed or variable rate \nas a single loan.\n2.Treat borrowed funds or parts of borrowed \nfunds on which interest accrues at differ-\nent fixed or variable rates as different \nloans. Treat these loans as repaid in the \norder shown on the loan agreement.\nLoan refinancing.  Allocate the replacement \nloan to the same uses to which the repaid loan \nwas allocated. Make this allocation only to the \nextent you use the proceeds of the new loan to \nrepay any part of the original loan.\nDebt- financed distribution.  A debt -financed \ndistribution occurs when a partnership or S cor-\nporation borrows funds and allocates those \nfunds to distributions made to partners or \nshareholders. The manner in which you report \nthe interest expense associated with the distrib-\nuted debt proceeds depends on your use of \nthose proceeds.\nHow to report.  If the proceeds were used \nin a nonpassive trade or business activity, re-\nport the interest on Schedule E (Form 1040), \nline 28; enter \u201cinterest expense\u201d and the name \nof the partnership or S corporation in column (a) \nand the amount in column (i). If the proceeds \nwere used in a passive activity, follow the In-\nstructions for Form 8582 to determine the \namount of interest expense that can be repor-\nted on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28; enter \n\u201cinterest expense\u201d and the name of the partner-\nship in column (a) and the amount in column \n(g). If the proceeds were used in an investment \nactivity, enter the interest on Form 4952. If the \nproceeds are used for personal purposes, the \ninterest is generally not deductible.Interest Expense \nLimitation\nYou must generally limit business interest ex-\npense you pay or accrue during the tax year, \nunless an exception to the limitation is met.\nThe business interest expense deduction al-\nlowed for a tax year is generally limited to the \nsum of:\n1.Business interest income,\n2.30% of the adjustable taxable income, and\n3.Floor plan financing interest.\nIf the section 163(j) limitation applies, gener-\nally the amount of any business interest ex-\npense that is not allowed as a deduction under \nsection 163(j) for the tax year is carried forward \nto the following year as a disallowed business \ninterest expense carryforward. See the Instruc-\ntions for Form 8990, Limitation on Business In-\nterest Expense Under Section 163(j), for more \ninformation.\nInterest You Can Deduct\nYour trade or business interest expense may be \nlimited. See the Instructions for Form 8990 for \nmore information. Interest relates to your trade \nor business if you use the proceeds of the loan \nfor a trade or business expense. It does not \nmatter what type of property secures the loan. \nYou can deduct interest on a debt only if you \nmeet all the following requirements.\n\u2022You are legally liable for that debt.\n\u2022Both you and the lender intend that the \ndebt be repaid.\n\u2022You and the lender have a true debtor\u2013\ncreditor relationship.\nPartial liability.  If you are liable for part of a \nbusiness debt, only your share of the total inter-\nest paid or accrued is included in your interest \nlimitation calculation.\nExample. You and your sibling borrow \nmoney. You are liable for 50% of the note. You \nuse your half of the loan in your business, and \nyou make one -half of the loan payments. Your \nbusiness interest is half of the total interest pay-\nments. However, the current year interest ex-\npense deduction may be limited.\nMortgage. Generally, mortgage interest paid \nor accrued on real estate you own legally or \nequitably is deductible. However, rather than \ndeducting the interest currently, you may have \nto add it to the cost basis of the property as ex-\nplained later under Capitalization of Interest .\nStatement. If you paid $600 or more of \nmortgage interest (including certain points) dur-\ning the year on any one mortgage, you will gen-\nerally receive a Form 1098 or a similar state-\nment. You will receive the statement if you pay \ninterest to a person (including a financial institu-\ntion or a cooperative housing corporation) in the \ncourse of that person's trade or business. A \ngovernmental unit is a person for purposes of \nfurnishing the statement.If you receive a refund of interest you over-\npaid in an earlier year, this amount will be repor-\nted in box 4 of Form 1098. You cannot deduct \nthis amount. For information on how to report \nthis refund, see Refunds of interest , later, in this \nchapter.\nExpenses paid to obtain a mortgage. \nCertain expenses you pay to obtain a mortgage \ncannot be deducted as interest. These expen-\nses, which include mortgage commissions, ab-\nstract fees, and recording fees, are capital ex-\npenses. If the property mortgaged is business \nor income -producing property, you can amor-\ntize the costs over the life of the mortgage.\nPrepayment penalty.  If you pay off your \nmortgage early and pay the lender a penalty for \ndoing this, you can deduct the penalty as inter-\nest.\nInterest on employment tax deficiency.  In-\nterest charged on employment taxes assessed \non your business is deductible.\nOriginal issue discount (OID).  OID is a form \nof interest. A loan (mortgage or other debt) gen-\nerally has OID when its proceeds are less than \nits principal amount. The OID is the difference \nbetween the stated redemption price at maturity \nand the issue price of the loan.\nA loan's stated redemption price at maturity \nis the sum of all amounts (principal and interest) \npayable on it other than qualified stated inter-\nest. Qualified stated interest is stated interest \nthat is unconditionally payable in cash or prop-\nerty (other than another loan of the issuer) at \nleast annually over the term of the loan at a sin-\ngle fixed rate.\nYou generally deduct OID over the term of \nthe loan. Figure the amount to deduct each year \nusing the constant -yield method, unless the \nOID on the loan is de minimis.\nDe minimis OID.  The OID is de minimis if it \nis less than one -fourth of 1% (0.0025) of the \nstated redemption price of the loan at maturity \nmultiplied by the number of full years from the \ndate of original issue to maturity (the term of the \nloan).\nIf the OID is de minimis, you can choose one \nof the following ways to figure the amount you \ncan deduct each year.\n\u2022On a constant-yield basis over the term of \nthe loan.\n\u2022On a straight-line basis over the term of the \nloan.\n\u2022In proportion to stated interest payments.\n\u2022In its entirety at maturity of the loan.\nYou make this choice by deducting the OID in a \nmanner consistent with the method chosen on \nyour timely filed tax return for the tax year in \nwhich the loan is issued.\nExample. On January 1, 2022, you took out \na $100,000 discounted loan and received \n$98,500 in proceeds. The loan will mature on \nJanuary 1, 2032 (a 10 -year term), and the \n$100,000 principal is payable on that date. In-\nterest of $10,000 is payable on January 1 of \neach year, beginning January 1, 2023. The \n$1,500 OID on the loan is de minimis because it \nis less than $2,500 ($100,000 \u00d7 0.0025 \u00d7 10). \nYou choose to deduct the OID on a straight -line Page 15 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

If the OID is not \nde minimis, you must use the constant -yield \nmethod to figure how much you can deduct \neach year. You figure your deduction for the first \nyear using the following steps.\n1.Determine the issue price of the loan. \nGenerally, this equals the proceeds of the \nloan. If you paid points on the loan (as dis-\ncussed later), the issue price is generally \nthe difference between the proceeds and \nthe points.\n2.Multiply the result in (1) by the yield to ma-\nturity.\n3.Subtract any qualified stated interest pay-\nments from the result in (2). This is the \nOID you can deduct in the first year.\nTo figure your deduction in any subsequent \nyear, follow the steps above, except determine \nthe adjusted issue price in step 1. To get the \nadjusted issue price, add to the issue price any \nOID previously deducted. Then follow steps 2 \nand 3 above.\nThe yield to maturity is generally shown in \nthe literature you receive from your lender. If \nyou do not have this information, consult your \nlender or tax advisor. In general, the yield to \nmaturity is the discount rate that, when used in \nfiguring the present value of all principal and in-\nterest payments, produces an amount equal to \nthe principal amount of the loan.\nExample. The facts are the same as in the \nprevious example, except that you deduct the \nOID on a constant -yield basis over the term of \nthe loan. The yield to maturity on your loan is \n10.2467%, compounded annually. For 2022, \nyou can deduct $93 [($98,500 \u00d7 0.102467) \u2212 \n$10,000]. For 2023, you can deduct $103 \n[($98,593 \u00d7 0.102467) \u2212 $10,000].\nLoan or mortgage ends.  If your loan or \nmortgage ends, you may be able to deduct any \nremaining OID in the tax year in which the loan \nor mortgage ends. A loan or mortgage may end \ndue to a refinancing, prepayment, foreclosure, \nor similar event.\nIf you refinance with the original lender, \nyou generally cannot deduct the re-\nmaining OID in the year in which the re-\nfinancing occurs, but you may be able to deduct \nit over the term of the new mortgage or loan. \nSee Interest paid with funds borrowed from \noriginal lender  under Interest You Cannot De-\nduct , later.\nPoints. The term \u201cpoints\u201d is used to describe \ncertain charges paid, or treated as paid, by a \nborrower to obtain a loan or a mortgage. These \ncharges are also called loan origination fees, \nmaximum loan charges, discount points, or pre-\nmium charges. If any of these charges (points) \nare solely for the use of money, they are inter-\nest.\nBecause points are prepaid interest, you \ngenerally cannot deduct the full amount in the \nyear paid. However, you can choose to fully de-\nduct points in the year paid if you meet certain \nCAUTION!tests. For exceptions to the general rule, see \nPub. 936.\nThe points reduce the issue price of the loan \nand result in OID, deductible as explained in the \npreceding discussion.\nPartial payments on a nontax debt.  If you \nmake partial payments on a debt (other than a \ndebt owed to the IRS), the payments are ap-\nplied, in general, first to interest and any re-\nmainder to principal. You can deduct only the \ninterest. This rule does not apply when it can be \ninferred that the borrower and lender under-\nstood that a different allocation of the payments \nwould be made.\nInstallment purchase.  If you make an install-\nment purchase of business property, the con-\ntract between you and the seller generally pro-\nvides for the payment of interest. If no interest \nor a low rate of interest is charged under the \ncontract, a portion of the stated principal \namount payable under the contract may be re-\ncharacterized as interest (unstated interest). \nThe amount recharacterized as interest reduces \nyour basis in the property and increases your \ninterest expense. For more information on in-\nstallment sales and unstated interest, see Pub. \n537.\nInterest You Cannot \nDeduct\nCertain interest payments cannot be deducted. \nIn addition, certain other expenses that may \nseem to be interest, but are not, cannot be de-\nducted as interest.\nYou cannot currently deduct interest that \nmust be capitalized, and you generally cannot \ndeduct personal interest.\nInterest paid with funds borrowed from \noriginal lender.  If you use the cash method of \naccounting, you cannot deduct interest you pay \nwith funds borrowed from the original lender \nthrough a second loan, an advance, or any \nother arrangement similar to a loan. You can \ndeduct the interest expense once you start \nmaking payments on the new loan.\nWhen you make a payment on the new loan, \nyou first apply the payment to interest and then \nto the principal. All amounts you apply to the in-\nterest on the first loan are deductible, along with \nany interest you pay on the second loan, sub-\nject to any limits that apply.\nCapitalized interest.  You cannot currently de-\nduct interest you are required to capitalize un-\nder the uniform capitalization rules. See Capi-\ntalization of Interest , later. In addition, if you buy \nproperty and pay interest owed by the seller (for \nexample, by assuming the debt and any interest \naccrued on the property), you cannot deduct \nthe interest. Add this interest to the basis of the \nproperty.\nCommitment fees or standby charges. Fees \nyou incur to have business funds available on a \nstandby basis, but not for the actual use of the \nfunds, are not deductible as interest payments. \nYou may be able to deduct them as business \nexpenses.If the funds are for inventory or certain prop-\nerty used in your business, the fees are indirect \ncosts and you must generally capitalize them \nunder the uniform capitalization rules. See Cap-\nitalization of Interest , later.\nInterest on income tax.  Interest charged on \nincome tax assessed on your individual income \ntax return is not a business deduction even \nthough the tax due is related to income from \nyour trade or business. Treat this interest as a \nbusiness deduction only in figuring a net operat-\ning loss deduction.\nPenalties. Penalties on underpaid deficien-\ncies and underpaid estimated tax are not inter-\nest. You cannot deduct them. Generally, you \ncannot deduct any fines or penalties.\nInterest on loans with respect to life insur-\nance policies.  You generally cannot deduct \ninterest on a debt incurred with respect to any \nlife insurance, annuity, or endowment contract \nthat covers any individual unless that individual \nis a key person.\nIf the policy or contract covers a key person, \nyou can deduct the interest on up to $50,000 of \ndebt for that person. However, the deduction for \nany month cannot be more than the interest fig-\nured using Moody's Composite Yield on Seas-\noned Corporate Bonds (formerly known as \nMoody's Corporate Bond Yield Aver-\nage\u2014 Monthly Average Corporates) (Moody's \nrate) for that month.\nWho is a key person?  A \u201ckey person\u201d is \nan officer or 20% owner. However, the number \nof individuals you can treat as key persons is \nlimited to the greater of the following.\n\u2022Five individuals.\n\u2022The lesser of 5% of the total officers and \nemployees of the company or 20 individu-\nals.\nExceptions for pre -June 1997 contracts. \nYou can generally deduct the interest if the con-\ntract was issued before June 9, 1997, and the \ncovered individual is someone other than an \nemployee, officer, or someone financially inter-\nested in your business. If the contract was pur-\nchased before June 21, 1986, you can gener-\nally deduct the interest no matter who is \ncovered by the contract.\nInterest allocated to unborrowed policy \ncash value.  Corporations and partnerships \ngenerally cannot deduct any interest expense \nallocable to unborrowed cash values of life in-\nsurance, annuity, or endowment contracts. This \nrule applies to contracts issued after June 8, \n1997, that cover someone other than an officer, \ndirector, employee, or 20% owner. For more in-\nformation, see section 264(f).\nCapitalization of Interest\nUnder the uniform capitalization rules, you must \ngenerally capitalize interest on debt equal to \nyour expenditures to produce real property or \ncertain tangible personal property. The property \nmust be produced by you for use in your trade \nor business or for sale to customers. You can-\nnot capitalize interest related to property that \nyou acquire in any other manner.Page 16 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Designa-\nted property is any of the following.\n\u2022Real property.\n\u2022Tangible personal property with a class life \nof 20 years or more.\n\u2022Tangible personal property with an estima-\nted production period of more than 2 \nyears.\n\u2022Tangible personal property with an estima-\nted production period of more than 1 year if \nthe estimated cost of production is more \nthan $1 million.\nProperty you produce.  You produce property \nif you construct, build, install, manufacture, de-\nvelop, improve, create, raise, or grow it. Treat \nproperty produced for you under a contract as \nproduced by you up to the amount you pay or \nincur for the property.\nCarrying charges.  Carrying charges include \ntaxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or \nto carry, transport, or install personal property. \nYou can choose to capitalize carrying charges \nnot subject to the uniform capitalization rules if \nthey are otherwise deductible. For more infor-\nmation, see chapter 7 .\nCapitalized interest.  Treat capitalized interest \nas a cost of the property produced. You recover \nyour interest when you sell or use the property. \nIf the property is inventory, recover capitalized \ninterest through cost of goods sold. If the prop-\nerty is used in your trade or business, recover \ncapitalized interest through an adjustment to \nbasis, depreciation, amortization, or other \nmethod.\nPartnerships and S corporations.  The inter-\nest capitalization rules are applied first at the \npartnership or S corporation level. The rules are \nthen applied at the partners' or shareholders' \nlevel to the extent the partnership or S corpora-\ntion has insufficient debt to support the produc-\ntion or construction costs.\nIf you are a partner or a shareholder, you \nmay have to capitalize interest you incur during \nthe tax year for the production costs of the part-\nnership or S corporation. You may also have to \ncapitalize interest incurred by the partnership or \nS corporation for your own production costs. To \nproperly capitalize interest under these rules, \nyou must be given the required information in \nan attachment to the Schedule K -1 you receive \nfrom the partnership or S corporation.\nAdditional information.  The procedures for \napplying the uniform capitalization rules are be-\nyond the scope of this publication. For more in-\nformation, see Regulations sections 1. 263A-8 \nthrough 1. 263A- 15 and Notice 88 -99, which is \nin Cumulative Bulletin 1988-2.\nWhen To Deduct Interest\nIf the uniform capitalization rules, discussed un-\nder Capitalization of Interest , earlier, and the \nbusiness interest expense deduction limitation \nrules discussed under Interest Expense Limita-\ntion, earlier, do not apply, deduct interest as fol-\nlows.Cash method.  Under the cash method, you \ncan generally deduct only the interest you ac-\ntually paid during the tax year. You cannot de-\nduct a promissory note you gave as payment \nbecause it is a promise to pay and not an actual \npayment.\nPrepaid interest. You generally cannot de-\nduct any interest paid before the year it is due. \nInterest paid in advance can be deducted only \nin the tax year in which it is due.\nDiscounted loan.  If interest or a discount \nis subtracted from your loan proceeds, it is not a \npayment of interest and you cannot deduct it \nwhen you get the loan. For more information, \nsee Original issue discount (OID)  under Interest \nYou Can Deduct , earlier.\nRefunds of interest.  If you pay interest \nand then receive a refund in the same tax year \nof any part of the interest, reduce your interest \ndeduction by the refund. If you receive the re-\nfund in a later tax year, include the refund in \nyour income to the extent the deduction for the \ninterest reduced your tax.\nAccrual method.  Under an accrual method, \nyou can deduct only interest that has accrued \nduring the tax year.\nPrepaid interest. You generally cannot de-\nduct any interest paid before the year it is due. \nInterest paid in advance can be deducted only \nin the tax year in which it is due.\nDiscounted loan.  If interest or a discount \nis subtracted from your loan proceeds, it is not a \npayment of interest and you cannot deduct it \nwhen you get the loan. For more information, \nsee Original issue discount (OID)  under Interest \nYou Can Deduct , earlier.\nTax deficiency.  If you contest a federal in-\ncome tax deficiency, interest does not accrue \nuntil the tax year the final determination of liabil-\nity is made. If you do not contest the deficiency, \nthen the interest accrues in the year the tax was \nasserted and agreed to by you.\nHowever, if you contest but pay the pro-\nposed tax deficiency and interest, and you do \nnot designate the payment as a cash bond, \nthen the interest is deductible in the year paid.\nRelated person.  If you use an accrual \nmethod, you cannot deduct interest owed to a \nrelated person who uses the cash method until \npayment is made and the interest is includible in \nthe gross income of that person. The relation-\nship is determined as of the end of the tax year \nfor which the interest would otherwise be de-\nductible. See section 267 for more information.\nBelow-Market Loans\nIf you receive a below -market gift or demand \nloan and use the proceeds in your trade or busi-\nness, you may be able to deduct the forgone in-\nterest. See Treatment of gift and demand loans , \nlater, in this discussion.\nA \u201cbelow -market loan\u201d is a loan on which no \ninterest is charged or on which interest is \ncharged at a rate below the applicable federal \nrate (AFR). A gift or demand loan that is a be-\nlow- market loan is generally considered an arm's- length transaction in which you, the bor-\nrower, are considered as having received both \nof the following.\n\u2022A loan in exchange for a note that requires \nthe payment of interest at the AFR.\n\u2022An additional payment in an amount equal \nto the forgone interest.\nThe additional payment is treated as a gift, divi-\ndend, contribution to capital, payment of com-\npensation, or other payment, depending on the \nsubstance of the transaction.\nForgone interest.  For any period, forgone in-\nterest is:\n1.The interest that would be payable for that \nperiod if interest accrued on the loan at the \nAFR and was payable annually on De-\ncember 31, minus\n2.Any interest actually payable on the loan \nfor the period.\nAFRs are published by the IRS each \nmonth in the Internal Revenue Bulletin \n(I.R.B.), which is available on the IRS \nwebsite at IRS.gov/IRB . You can also contact \nan IRS office to get these rates.\nLoans subject to the rules.  The rules for be-\nlow-market loans apply to the following.\n1.Gift loans (below-market loans where the \nforgone interest is in the nature of a gift).\n2.Compensation-related loans (below-mar-\nket loans between an employer and an \nemployee or between an independent \ncontractor and a person for whom the con-\ntractor provides services).\n3.Corporation-shareholder loans.\n4.Tax avoidance loans (below-market loans \nwhere the avoidance of federal tax is one \nof the main purposes of the interest ar-\nrangement).\n5.Loans to qualified continuing care facilities \nunder a continuing care contract (made af-\nter October 11, 1985).\nExcept as noted in (5) above, these rules \napply to demand loans (loans payable in full at \nany time upon the lender's demand) outstand-\ning after June 6, 1984, and to term loans (loans \nthat are not demand loans) made after that \ndate.\nTreatment of gift and demand loans.  If you \nreceive a below -market gift loan or demand \nloan, you are treated as receiving an additional \npayment (as a gift, dividend, etc.) equal to the \nforgone interest on the loan. You are then trea-\nted as transferring this amount back to the \nlender as interest. These transfers are consid-\nered to occur annually, generally on December \n31. If you use the loan proceeds in your trade or \nbusiness, you can deduct the forgone interest \neach year as a business interest expense. The \nlender must report it as interest income.\nLimit on forgone interest for gift loans of \n$100,000 or less.  For gift loans between indi-\nviduals, forgone interest treated as transferred \nback to the lender is limited to the borrower's \nnet investment income for the year. This limit \napplies if the outstanding loans between the \nTIPPage 17 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

        "content": "Limitation on acceleration of accrual of \ntaxes. A taxing jurisdiction can require the use \nof a date for accruing taxes that is earlier than \nthe date it originally required. However, if you \nuse an accrual method, and can deduct the tax \nbefore you pay it, use the original accrual date \nfor the year of change and all future years to de-\ntermine when you can deduct the tax.\nExample. Your state imposes a tax on per-\nsonal property used in a trade or business con-\nducted in the state. This tax is assessed and \nbecomes a lien as of July 1 (accrual date). In \n2022, the state changed the assessment and \nlien dates from July 1, 2023, to December 31, \n2022, for property tax year 2023. Use the origi-\nnal accrual date (July 1, 2023) to determine \nwhen you can deduct the tax. You must also \nuse the July 1 accrual date for all future years to \ndetermine when you can deduct the tax.\nUniform capitalization rules.  Uniform capital-\nization rules apply to certain taxpayers who pro-\nduce real property or tangible personal property \nfor use in a trade or business or for sale to cus-\ntomers. They also apply to certain taxpayers \nwho acquire property for resale. Under these \nrules, you either include certain costs in inven-\ntory or capitalize certain expenses related to the \nproperty, such as taxes. For more information, \nsee chapter 1 .\nCarrying charges.  Carrying charges include \ntaxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or \nto carry, transport, or install personal property. \nYou can elect to capitalize carrying charges not \nsubject to the uniform capitalization rules if they \nare otherwise deductible. For more information, \nsee chapter 7 .\nRefunds of taxes.  If you receive a refund for \nany taxes you deducted in an earlier year, in-\nclude the refund in income to the extent the de-\nduction reduced your federal income tax in the \nearlier year. For more information, see Recov-\nery of amount deducted (tax benefit rule)  in \nchapter 1 .\nYou must include in income any inter-\nest you receive on tax refunds.\nReal Estate Taxes\nDeductible real estate taxes are any state or lo-\ncal taxes, including taxes imposed by U.S. pos-\nsessions, on real estate levied for the general \npublic welfare. The taxing authority must base \nthe taxes on the assessed value of the real es-\ntate and charge them uniformly against all prop-\nerty under its jurisdiction. Deductible real estate \ntaxes generally do not include taxes charged for \nlocal benefits and improvements that increase \nthe value of the property. See Taxes for local \nbenefits , later.\nReal estate taxes imposed by a foreign \ncountry are not deductible unless paid or ac-\ncrued in connection with the conduct of a trade \nor business or for the production of income. For \nindividual tax filers, the amount of deductible \nstate and local real estate taxes may be subject \nto a $10,000 limitation. See State and local in-\ncome taxes , later.\nTIPIf you use an accrual method, you generally \ncannot accrue real estate taxes until you pay \nthem to the government authority. However, \nyou can elect to ratably accrue the taxes during \nthe year. See Electing to ratably accrue , later.\nTaxes for local benefits.  Generally, you can-\nnot deduct taxes charged for local benefits and \nimprovements that tend to increase the value of \nyour property. These include assessments for \nstreets, sidewalks, water mains, sewer lines, \nand public parking facilities. You should in-\ncrease the basis of your property by the amount \nof the assessment.\nYou can deduct taxes for these local bene-\nfits only if the taxes are for maintenance, re-\npairs, or interest charges related to those bene-\nfits. If part of the tax is for maintenance, repairs, \nor interest, you must be able to show how much \nof the tax is for these expenses to claim a de-\nduction for that part of the tax.\nExample. To improve downtown commer-\ncial business, Waterfront City converted a \ndowntown business area street into an en-\nclosed pedestrian mall. The city assessed the \nfull cost of construction, financed with 10 -year \nbonds, against the affected properties. The city \nis paying the principal and interest with the an-\nnual payments made by the property owners.\nThe assessments for construction costs are \nnot deductible as taxes or as business expen-\nses, but are depreciable capital expenses. The \npart of the payments used to pay the interest \ncharges on the bonds is deductible as taxes.\nCharges for services.  Water bills, sewerage, \nand other service charges assessed against \nyour business property are not real estate \ntaxes, but are deductible as business expen-\nses.\nPurchase or sale of real estate.  If real estate \nis sold, the real estate taxes must be allocated \nbetween the buyer and the seller.\nThe buyer and seller must allocate the real \nestate taxes according to the number of days in \nthe real property tax year (the period to which \nthe tax imposed relates) that each owned the \nproperty. Treat the seller as paying the taxes up \nto but not including the date of sale. Treat the \nbuyer as paying the taxes beginning with the \ndate of sale. You can usually find this informa-\ntion on the settlement statement you received at \nclosing.\nIf you (the seller) use an accrual method and \nhave not elected to ratably accrue real estate \ntaxes, you are considered to have accrued your \npart of the tax on the date you sell the property.\nExample. Lynn and Curt are calendar year \naccrual method taxpayers who own real estate \nin Olmo County. They have not elected to rata-\nbly accrue property taxes. November 30 of \neach year is the assessment and lien date for \nthe current real property tax year, which is the \ncalendar year. They sold the property on June \n30, 2022. Under their accounting method, they \nwould not be able to claim a deduction for the \ntaxes because the sale occurred before No-\nvember 30. They are treated as having accrued \ntheir part of the tax, 181/365  (January 1\u2013June \n29), on June 30, and they can deduct it for \n2022.Electing to ratably accrue.  If you use an ac-\ncrual method, you can elect to accrue real es-\ntate tax related to a definite period ratably over \nthat period.\nExample. Lea and Joey are calendar year \ntaxpayers who use an accrual method. Their \nreal estate taxes for the real property tax year, \nJuly 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, are $1,200. July \n1 is the assessment and lien date.\nIf the Lea and Joey elect to ratably accrue \nthe taxes, $600 will accrue in 2022 ($1,200 \u00d7 \n6/12, July 1\u2013December 31) and the balance will \naccrue in 2023.\nSeparate elections.  You can elect to rata-\nbly accrue the taxes for each separate trade or \nbusiness and for nonbusiness activities if you \naccount for them separately. Once you elect to \nratably accrue real estate taxes, you must use \nthat method unless you get permission from the \nIRS to change your accounting method. See \nForm 3115 , later.\nMaking the election.  If you elect to ratably \naccrue the taxes for the first year in which you \nincur real estate taxes, attach a statement to \nyour income tax return for that year. The state-\nment should show all the following items.\n\u2022The trades or businesses to which the \nelection applies and the accounting \nmethod or methods used.\n\u2022The period to which the taxes relate.\n\u2022The calculation of the real estate tax de-\nduction for that first year.\nGenerally, you must file your return by the \ndue date (including extensions). However, if \nyou timely filed your return for the year without \nelecting to ratably accrue, you can still make the \nelection by filing an amended return within 6 \nmonths after the due date of the return (exclud-\ning extensions). Attach the statement to the \namended return and write \u201cFiled pursuant to \nsection 301. 9100- 2\u201d on the statement. File the \namended return at the same address where you \nfiled the original return.\nForm 3115.  If you elect to ratably accrue \nreal estate taxes for a year after the first year in \nwhich you incur real estate taxes, or if you want \nto revoke your election to ratably accrue real \nestate taxes, file Form 3115. For more informa-\ntion, including applicable time frames for filing, \nsee the Instructions for Form 3115.\nIncome Taxes\nThis section discusses federal, state, local, and \nforeign income taxes.\nFederal income taxes.  You cannot deduct \nfederal income taxes.\nState and local income taxes.  A corporation \nor partnership can deduct state and local in-\ncome taxes imposed on the corporation or part-\nnership as business expenses.\nAn individual can deduct state and local in-\ncome taxes only as an itemized deduction on \nSchedule A (Form 1040), subject to limitations. \nThe deduction is limited to $10,000 as a total of \nthe following taxes.Page 19 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

See the \nSchedule A (Form 1040) instructions. See \nalso Real Estate Taxes , earlier.\n3.State and local personal property taxes.\nHowever, an individual can deduct a state \ntax on gross income (as distinguished from net \nincome) directly attributable to a trade or busi-\nness as a business expense.\nAccrual of contested income taxes.  If \nyou use an accrual method, and you contest a \nstate or local income tax liability, you must ac-\ncrue and deduct any contested amount in the \ntax year in which the liability is finally deter-\nmined.\nIf additional state or local income taxes for a \nprior year are assessed in a later year, you can \ndeduct the taxes in the year in which they were \noriginally imposed (the prior year) if the tax lia-\nbility is not contested. You cannot deduct them \nin the year in which the liability is finally deter-\nmined.\nThe filing of an income tax return is not \nconsidered a contest and, in the ab-\nsence of an overt act of protest, you \ncan deduct the tax in the prior year. Also, you \ncan deduct any additional taxes in the prior year \nif you do not show some affirmative evidence of \ndenial of the liability.\nHowever, if you consistently deduct addi-\ntional assessments in the year they are paid or \nfinally determined (including those for which \nthere was no contest), you must continue to do \nso. You cannot take a deduction in the earlier \nyear unless you receive permission to change \nyour method of accounting. For more informa-\ntion on accounting methods, see When Can I \nDeduct an Expense  in chapter 1 .\nIf you contest a state or local tax liability, and \nyou transfer money or other property as a provi-\nsional payment of the contested tax liability, you \ncan accrue and deduct the amount of the con-\ntested tax liability for which you made the provi-\nsional payment in the year in which you made \nthe payment, even though the liability is not de-\ntermined until a later year.\nIf any portion of the contested amount which \nwas deducted in the year the provisional pay-\nment was made is later refunded when the con-\ntest is settled, you must include such portion in \nyour gross income in the year the refund is re-\nceived.\nNotwithstanding the exception that allows \naccrual and deduction of contested state or lo-\ncal income tax liability upon payment, current \naccrual and deduction is not allowed for in-\ncome, war profits, and excess profits taxes im-\nposed by a foreign country or possession of the \nUnited States.\nForeign income taxes.  Generally, you can \ntake either a deduction or a credit for income \ntaxes imposed on you by a foreign country or a \nU.S. possession, subject to limitations. How-\never, an individual cannot take a deduction or \ncredit for foreign income taxes paid on income \nthat is exempt from U.S. tax under the foreign \nearned income exclusion or the foreign housing \nexclusion. For information on these exclusions, \nTIPsee Pub. 54. For information on the foreign tax \ncredit, see Pub. 514.\nAccrual of foreign income taxes.  If you \nuse an accrual method and choose to take a \ndeduction (rather than a credit) for foreign in-\ncome taxes, you can deduct the taxes in the \nyear in which the fact of the liability becomes \nfixed and the amount of the liability can be de-\ntermined with reasonable accuracy. Generally, \nthis is the year with or within which the tax year \nthat applies for foreign tax purposes ends or, in \nthe case of a contested tax, the year in which \nthe contest is resolved. Different rules may ap-\nply to determine when a foreign income tax is \nconsidered to accrue for purposes of the for-\neign tax credit. For more information on the for-\neign tax credit, see Pub. 514.\nEmployment Taxes\nIf you have employees, you must withhold vari-\nous taxes from your employees' pay. Most em-\nployers must withhold their employees' share of \nsocial security, Medicare taxes, and Additional \nMedicare Tax (if applicable), along with state \nand federal income taxes. You may also need \nto pay certain employment taxes from your own \nfunds. These include your share of social secur-\nity and Medicare taxes as an employer, along \nwith unemployment taxes.\nYour deduction for wages paid is not re-\nduced by the social security and Medicare \ntaxes, Additional Medicare Tax, and income \ntaxes you withhold from your employees. You \ncan deduct the employment taxes you must pay \nfrom your own funds as taxes.\nExample. You pay your employee $18,000 \na year. However, after you withhold various \ntaxes, your employee receives $14,500. You \nalso pay an additional $1,500 in employment \ntaxes. You should deduct the full $18,000 as \nwages. You can deduct the $1,500 you pay \nfrom your own funds as taxes.\nAdditional Medicare Tax.  You must withhold \na 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax from wages \nyou pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 \nin a calendar year. The Additional Medicare Tax \nis only imposed on the employee. There is no \nemployer share of Additional Medicare Tax.\nFor more information on the Additional Med-\nicare Tax, see Form 8959 and its instructions.\nFor more information on employment \ntaxes, see Pub. 15 (Circular E).\nUnemployment fund taxes.  As an employer, \nyou may have to make payments to a state un-\nemployment compensation fund or to a state \ndisability benefit fund. Deduct these payments \nas taxes.\nSelf- employment tax.  You can deduct part of \nyour self -employment tax as a business ex-\npense in figuring your adjusted gross income. \nThis deduction only affects your income tax. It \ndoes not affect your net earnings from self -em-\nployment or your self-employment tax.\nTo deduct the tax, enter on Schedule 1 \n(Form 1040), line 15, the amount shown on the \nTIPDeduction for one -half of self -employment tax \nline of Schedule SE (Form 1040).\nFor more information on self -employment \ntax, see Pub. 334.\nAdditional Medicare Tax.  You may be re-\nquired to pay Additional Medicare Tax on \nself- employment income. See Form 8959 and \nthe Instructions for Form 8959 for more informa-\ntion on the Additional Medicare Tax.\nOther Taxes\nThe following are other taxes you can deduct if \nyou incur them in the ordinary course of your \ntrade or business.\nExcise taxes.  Generally, you can deduct as a \nbusiness expense all excise taxes that are ordi-\nnary and necessary expenses of carrying on \nyour trade or business. However, see Fuel \ntaxes , later.\nFor more information on excise taxes, see \nPub. 510.\nFranchise taxes.  You can deduct corporate \nfranchise taxes as a business expense.\nFuel taxes.  Generally, taxes on gasoline, die-\nsel fuel, and other motor fuels that you use in \nyour business are included as part of the cost of \nthe fuel. Do not deduct these taxes as a sepa-\nrate item.\nYou may be entitled to a credit or refund for \nfederal excise tax you paid on fuels used for \ncertain purposes. For more information, see \nPub. 510.\nOccupational taxes.  You can deduct as a \nbusiness expense an occupational tax charged \nat a flat rate by a locality for the privilege of \nworking or conducting a business in the locality.\nPersonal property tax.  You can deduct any \ntax imposed by a state or local government on \npersonal property used in your trade or busi-\nness.\nSales tax.  Any sales tax you pay on a service \nfor your business, or on the purchase or use of \nproperty in your business is treated as part of \nthe cost of the service or property. If the service \nor the cost or use of the property is a deductible \nbusiness expense, you can deduct the tax as \npart of that service or cost. If the property is \nmerchandise bought for resale, the sales tax is \npart of the cost of the merchandise. If the prop-\nerty is depreciable, add the sales tax to the ba-\nsis for depreciation. For more information on \nbasis, see Pub. 551.\nDo not deduct state and local sales \ntaxes imposed on the buyer that you \nmust collect and pay over to the state \nor local government. Also, do not include these \ntaxes in gross receipts or sales.\nCAUTION!Page 20 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Subtract the \nhealth insurance deduction from your medical \ninsurance when figuring medical expenses on \nSchedule A (Form 1040) if you itemize deduc-\ntions.\nEffect on self -employment tax.  You can\u2019t \nsubtract the self -employed health insurance de-\nduction when figuring net earnings for your \nself- employment tax from the business under \nwhich the insurance plan is established, or con-\nsidered to be established, as discussed earlier. \nFor more information, see Schedule SE (Form \n1040).\nHow to figure the deduction.  Generally, you \ncan use the worksheet in the Form 1040 in-\nstructions to figure your deduction. However, if \nany of the following apply, you must use Work-\nsheet 6-A in this chapter.\n\u2022You had more than one source of income \nsubject to self-employment tax.\n\u2022You file Form 2555.\n\u2022You are using amounts paid for qualified \nlong-term care insurance to figure the de-\nduction.\nMore than one health plan and business. \nIf you have more than one health plan during \nthe year and each plan is established under a \ndifferent business, you must use separate work-\nsheets (Worksheet 6 -A) to figure each plan's \nnet earnings limit. Include the premium you paid \nunder each plan on line 1 or line 2 of that sepa-\nrate worksheet and your net profit (or wages) \nfrom that business on line 4 (or line 11). For a \nplan that provides long -term care insurance, the \ntotal of the amounts entered for each person on \nline 2 of all worksheets can\u2019t be more than the \nappropriate limit shown on line 2 for that per-\nson.\nNondeductible \nPremiums\nYou can\u2019t deduct premiums on the following \nkinds of insurance.\n1.Self-insurance reserve funds. You can\u2019t \ndeduct amounts credited to a reserve set \nup for self-insurance. This applies even if \nyou can\u2019t get business insurance cover-\nage for certain business risks. However, \nyour actual losses may be deductible. See \nPub. 547.\n2.Loss of earnings. You can\u2019t deduct premi-\nums for a policy that pays for lost earnings \ndue to sickness or disability. However, see the discussion on overhead insurance, \nitem (8), under Deductible Premiums , ear-\nlier.\n3.Certain life insurance and annuities.\na.For contracts issued before June 9, \n1997, you can\u2019t deduct the premiums \non a life insurance policy covering \nyou, an employee, or any person with \na financial interest in your business if \nyou are directly or indirectly a benefi-\nciary of the policy. You are included \namong possible beneficiaries of the \npolicy if the policy owner is obligated \nto repay a loan from you using the \nproceeds of the policy. A person has \na financial interest in your business if \nthe person is an owner or part owner \nof the business or has lent money to \nthe business.\nb.For contracts issued after June 8, \n1997, you generally can\u2019t deduct the \npremiums on any life insurance policy, \nendowment contract, or annuity con-\ntract if you are directly or indirectly a \nbeneficiary. The disallowance applies \nwithout regard to whom the policy \ncovers.\nc.Partners. If, as a partner in a partner-\nship, you take out an insurance policy \non your own life and name your part-\nners as beneficiaries to induce them \nto retain their investments in the part-\nnership, you are considered a benefi-\nciary. You can't deduct the insurance \npremiums.\n4.Insurance to secure a loan. If you take out \na policy on your life or on the life of an-\nother person with a financial interest in \nyour business to get or protect a business \nloan, you can't deduct the premiums as a \nbusiness expense. Nor can you deduct \nthe premiums as interest on business \nloans or as an expense of financing loans. \nIn the event of death, the proceeds of the \npolicy are generally not taxed as income \neven if they are used to liquidate the debt.\nCapitalized Premiums\nUnder the uniform capitalization rules, you must \ncapitalize the direct costs and part of the indi-\nrect costs for certain production or resale activi-\nties. Include these costs in the basis of property \nyou produce or acquire for resale, rather than \nclaiming them as a current deduction. You re-\ncover the costs through depreciation, amortiza-\ntion, or cost of goods sold when you use, sell, \nor otherwise dispose of the property.\nIndirect costs include premiums for insur-\nance on your plant or facility, machinery, equip-\nment, materials, property produced, or property \nacquired for resale.\nUniform capitalization rules.  You may be \nsubject to the uniform capitalization rules if you \ndo any of the following, unless the property is \nproduced for your use other than in a business \nor an activity carried on for profit.1.Produce real property or tangible personal \nproperty. For this purpose, tangible per-\nsonal property includes a film, sound re-\ncording, videotape, book, or similar prop-\nerty.\n2.Acquire property for resale.\nHowever, these rules don't apply to the follow-\ning property.\n1.Personal property you acquire for resale if \nyour average annual gross receipts are \n$27 million or less for the 3 prior tax years.\n2.Property you produce if you meet either of \nthe following conditions.\na.Your indirect costs of producing the \nproperty are $200,000 or less.\nb.You use the cash method of account-\ning and don't account for inventories.\nMore information.  For more information on \nthese rules, see Uniform Capitalization Rules  in \nPub. 538 and the regulations under section \n263A.\nWhen To Deduct \nPremiums\nYou can usually deduct insurance premiums in \nthe tax year to which they apply.\nCash method.  If you use the cash method of \naccounting, you generally deduct insurance \npremiums in the tax year you actually paid \nthem, even if you incurred them in an earlier \nyear. However, see Prepayment , later.\nAccrual method.  If you use an accrual \nmethod of accounting, you can't deduct insur-\nance premiums before the tax year in which you \nincur a liability for them. In addition, you can't \ndeduct insurance premiums before the tax year \nin which you actually pay them (unless the ex-\nception for recurring items applies). For more \ninformation about the accrual method of ac-\ncounting, see chapter 1 . For information about \nthe exception for recurring items, see Pub. 538.\nPrepayment. You can't deduct expenses in \nadvance, even if you pay them in advance. This \nrule applies to any expense paid far enough in \nadvance to, in effect, create an asset with a \nuseful life extending substantially beyond the \nend of the current tax year.\nExpenses such as insurance are generally \nallocable to a period of time. You can deduct in-\nsurance expenses for the year to which they are \nallocable.\nExample.  In 2022, you signed a 3 -year in-\nsurance contract. Even though you paid the \npremiums for 2022, 2023, and 2024 when you \nsigned the contract, you can only deduct the \npremium for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You \ncan deduct in 2023 and 2024 the premiums al-\nlocable to those years.\nDividends received.  If you receive dividends \nfrom business insurance and you deducted the \npremiums in prior years, at least part of the divi-\ndends are generally income.

Begin-\nning January 1, 2022, research and experimen-\ntal expenditures, generally, have to be amor-\ntized over a 5 -year period. A business cannot \nelect to deduct their total research expenses in \nthe current year. See Research and Experimen-\ntal Costs  in chapter 7  and  chapter 8 .\nIntroduction\nThis chapter discusses costs you can elect to \ndeduct or capitalize.\nYou generally deduct a cost as a current \nbusiness expense by subtracting it from your in-\ncome in either the year you incur it or the year \nyou pay it.\nIf you capitalize a cost, you may be able to \nrecover it over a period of years through peri-\nodic deductions for amortization, depletion, or \ndepreciation. When you capitalize a cost, you \nadd it to the basis of property to which it relates.\nA partnership, corporation, estate, or trust \nmakes the election to deduct or capitalize the \ncosts discussed in this chapter except for ex-\nploration costs for mineral deposits. Each indi-\nvidual partner, shareholder, or beneficiary \nelects whether to deduct or capitalize explora-\ntion costs.\nIndividuals, estates, and trusts may be \nsubject to AMT if they deduct certain \nresearch and experimental, intangible \ndrilling, exploration, development, circulation, or \nbusiness organizational costs.\nFor more information on the AMT, see the \nInstructions for Form 6251 and the Instructions \nfor Schedule I (Form 1041).\nTopics\nThis chapter discusses:\n\u2022Carrying charges\n\u2022Research and experimental costs\n\u2022Intangible drilling costs\n\u2022Exploration costs\n\u2022Development costs\n\u2022Circulation costs\n\u2022Business startup and organizational costs\n\u2022Reforestation costs\nCAUTION!\u2022Retired asset removal costs\n\u2022Barrier removal costs\n\u2022Film and television production costs\n\u2022Repair and maintenance costs\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\nPublication\n544 Sales and Other Dispositions of \nAssets\nForm (and Instructions)\nSchedule C (Form 1040) Profit or Loss \nFrom Business\n3468 Investment Credit\n6765 Credit for Increasing Research \nActivities\n8826 Disabled Access Credit\nT (Timber) Forest Activities Schedule\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nCarrying Charges\nCarrying charges include the taxes and interest \nyou pay to carry or develop real property or to \ncarry, transport, or install personal property. \nCertain carrying charges must be capitalized \nunder the uniform capitalization rules. (For infor-\nmation on capitalization of interest, see chap-\nter 4 .) You can elect to capitalize carrying \ncharges not subject to the uniform capitalization \nrules, but only if they are otherwise deductible.\nYou can elect to capitalize carrying charges \nseparately for each project you have and for \neach type of carrying charge. Your election is \ngood for only 1 year for unimproved and unpro-\nductive real property. You must decide whether \nto capitalize carrying charges each year the \nproperty remains unimproved and unproduc-\ntive. For other real property, your election to \ncapitalize carrying charges remains in effect un-\ntil construction or development is completed. \nFor personal property, your election is effective \nuntil the date you install or first use it, whichever \nis later.\nHow to make the election.  To make the elec-\ntion to capitalize a carrying charge, attach a \nstatement to your original tax return for the year \nthe election is to be effective indicating which \ncharges you are electing to capitalize. However, \nif you timely filed your return for the year without \nmaking the election, you can still make the elec-\ntion by filing an amended return within 6 months \nof the due date of the return (excluding exten-\nsions). Attach the statement to the amended re-\nturn and write \u201cFiled pursuant to section \n301.9100- 2\u201d on the statement. File the amen-\nded return at the same address you filed the \noriginal return.\nResearch and \nExperimental Costs\nResearch or experimental expenditures paid or \nincurred in tax years beginning after December   544\n  Schedule C (Form 1040)\n  3468\n  6765\n  8826\n  T (Timber)31, 2021, must be charged to a separate speci-\nfied research or experimental capital account \nand amortized ratably over a 5 -year period or a \n15-year period for foreign research. The expen-\nses cannot be deducted in full in the current \nyear.\nFor information on amortizing these costs, \nsee Research and Experimental Costs  in chap-\nter 8 .\nResearch and experimental costs defined. \nResearch or experimental expenditures, as \nused in section 174, are research and develop-\nment costs, including costs incident to research \nin the experimental or laboratory sense, you in-\ncur in connection with your trade or business for \nactivities intended to provide information that \nwould eliminate uncertainty about the develop-\nment or improvement of a product. Uncertainty \nexists if the information available to you does \nnot establish how to develop or improve a prod-\nuct or the appropriate design of a product. \nWhether costs qualify as research and experi-\nmental expenditures depends on the nature of \nthe activity to which the costs relate rather than \non the nature of the product or improvement be-\ning developed or the level of technological ad-\nvancement.\nThe costs of obtaining a patent, including at-\ntorneys' fees paid or incurred in making and \nperfecting a patent application, are research \nand experimental expenditures. However, costs \npaid or incurred to obtain another's patent are \nnot research and experimental expenditures.\nThe costs related to developing software are \ntreated as research and experimental expendi-\ntures.\nProduct.

The payroll tax credit is an \nannual election made by a qualified small busi-\nness specifying the amount of research credit, \nnot to exceed $250,000, that may be used \nagainst the employer portion of social security \nliability. The credit is the smallest of the current \nyear research credit, an elected amount not to \nexceed $250,000, or the general business \ncredit carryforward for the tax year (before the \napplication of the payroll tax credit election for \nthe tax year). The election must be made on or \nbefore the due date of the originally filed return \n(including extensions). An election cannot be \nmade for a tax year if an election was made for \n5 or more preceding tax years. The election \nmade by a partnership or S corporation is made \nat the entity level.\nA qualified small business that elects to \nclaim the payroll tax credit will claim the payroll \ntax credit against the employer's portion of so-\ncial security tax on its employment tax return for \nthe first quarter that begins after it files the re-\nturn reflecting the payroll tax election. For more \ninformation, see the Instructions for Form 6765.\nIntangible Drilling Costs\nThe costs of developing oil, gas, or geothermal \nwells are ordinarily capital expenditures. You \ncan usually recover them through depreciation \nor depletion. However, you can elect to deduct \nintangible drilling costs (IDCs) as a current busi-\nness expense. These are certain drilling and \ndevelopment costs for wells in the United \nStates in which you hold an operating or work-\ning interest. You can deduct only costs for drill-\ning or preparing a well for the production of oil, \ngas, or geothermal steam or hot water.\nYou can elect to deduct only the costs of \nitems with no salvage value. These include wa-\nges, fuel, repairs, hauling, and supplies related \nto drilling wells and preparing them for produc-\ntion. Your cost for any drilling or development \nwork done by contractors under any form of \ncontract is also an IDC. However, see Amounts \npaid to contractor that must be capitalized , \nlater.\nYou can also elect to deduct the cost of drill-\ning exploratory bore holes to determine the lo-\ncation and delineation of offshore hydrocarbon \ndeposits if the shaft is capable of conducting \nhydrocarbons to the surface on completion. It \ndoes not matter whether there is any intent to \nproduce hydrocarbons.\nIf you do not elect to deduct your IDCs as a \ncurrent business expense, you can elect to de-\nduct them over the 60 -month period beginning \nwith the month they were paid or incurred.\nAmounts paid to contractor that must be \ncapitalized. Amounts paid to a contractor \nmust be capitalized if they are either:\n\u2022Amounts properly allocable to the cost of \ndepreciable property, or\n\u2022Amounts paid only out of production or \nproceeds from production if these amounts \nare depletable income to the recipient.How to make the election.  You elect to de-\nduct IDCs as a current business expense by \ntaking the deduction on your income tax return \nfor the first tax year you have eligible costs. No \nformal statement is required. If you file Sched-\nule C (Form 1040), enter these costs under \n\u201cOther expenses.\u201d\nFor oil and gas wells, your election is bind-\ning for the year it is made and for all later years. \nFor geothermal wells, your election can be re-\nvoked by the filing of an amended return on \nwhich you do not take the deduction. You can \nfile the amended return for the year up to the \nnormal time of expiration for filing a claim for \ncredit or refund, generally, within 3 years after \nthe date you filed the original return or within 2 \nyears after the date you paid the tax, whichever \nis later.\nEnergy credit for costs of geothermal wells. \nIf you capitalize the drilling and development \ncosts of geothermal wells that you place in serv-\nice during the tax year, you may be able to \nclaim a business energy credit. See the Instruc-\ntions for Form 3468 for more information.\nNonproductive well.  If you capitalize your \nIDCs, you have another option if the well is non-\nproductive. You can deduct the IDCs of the \nnonproductive well as an ordinary loss. You \nmust indicate and clearly state your election on \nyour tax return for the year the well is comple-\nted. Once made, the election for oil and gas \nwells is binding for all later years. You can re-\nvoke your election for a geothermal well by filing \nan amended return that does not claim the loss.\nCosts incurred outside the United States. \nYou cannot deduct as a current business ex-\npense all the IDCs paid or incurred for an oil, \ngas, or geothermal well located outside the Uni-\nted States. However, you can elect to include \nthe costs in the adjusted basis of the well to fig-\nure depletion or depreciation. If you do not \nmake this election, you can deduct the costs \nover the 10 -year period beginning with the tax \nyear in which you paid or incurred them. These \nrules do not apply to a nonproductive well.\nExploration Costs\nThe costs of determining the existence, loca-\ntion, extent, or quality of any mineral deposit are \nordinarily capital expenditures if the costs lead \nto the development of a mine. You recover \nthese costs through depletion as the mineral is \nremoved from the ground. However, you can \nelect to deduct domestic exploration costs paid \nor incurred before the beginning of the develop-\nment stage of the mine (except those for oil and \ngas wells).\nHow to make the election.  You elect to de-\nduct exploration costs by taking the deduction \non your income tax return, or on an amended \nincome tax return, for the first tax year for which \nyou wish to deduct the costs paid or incurred \nduring the tax year. Your return must ade-\nquately describe and identify each property or \nmine, and clearly state how much is being de-\nducted for each one. The election applies to the \ntax year you make this election and all later tax \nyears.Partnerships and S corporations.  Each \npartner, not the partnership, elects whether to \ncapitalize or to deduct that partner's share of \nexploration costs. Each shareholder, not the S \ncorporation, elects whether to capitalize or to \ndeduct that shareholder's share of exploration \ncosts.\nReduced corporate deductions for explora-\ntion costs.  A corporation (other than an S cor-\nporation) can deduct only 70% of its domestic \nexploration costs. It must capitalize the remain-\ning 30% of costs and amortize them over the \n60-month period starting with the month the ex-\nploration costs are paid or incurred. A corpora-\ntion may also elect to capitalize and amortize \nmining exploration costs over a 10 -year period. \nFor more information on this method of amorti-\nzation, see section 59(e).\nThe 30% that the corporation capitalizes \ncannot be added to its basis in the property to \nfigure cost depletion. However, the amount \namortized is treated as additional depreciation \nand is subject to recapture as ordinary income \non a disposition of the property. See Section \n1250 Property  under Depreciation Recapture  in \nchapter 3 of Pub. 544.\nThese rules also apply to the deduction of \ndevelopment costs by corporations. See Devel-\nopment Costs , later.\nRecapture of exploration expenses.  When \nyour mine reaches the producing stage, you \nmust recapture any exploration costs you elec-\nted to deduct. Use either of the following meth-\nods.\n Method 1\u2014Include the deducted costs in \ngross income for the tax year the mine rea-\nches the producing stage. Your election \nmust be clearly indicated on the return. In-\ncrease your adjusted basis in the mine by \nthe amount included in income. Generally, \nyou must elect this recapture method by \nthe due date (including extensions) of your \nreturn. However, if you timely filed your re-\nturn for the year without making the elec-\ntion, you can still make the election by filing \nan amended return within 6 months of the \ndue date of the return (excluding exten-\nsions). Make the election on your amended \nreturn and write \u201cFiled pursuant to section \n301.9100-2\u201d on the form where you are in-\ncluding the income. File the amended re-\nturn at the same address you filed the origi-\nnal return.\n Method 2\u2014Do not claim any depletion de-\nduction for the tax year the mine reaches \nthe producing stage and any later tax years \nuntil the depletion you would have deduc-\nted equals the exploration costs you de-\nducted.\nYou must also recapture deducted explora-\ntion costs if you receive a bonus or royalty from \nmine property before it reaches the producing \nstage. Do not claim any depletion deduction for \nthe tax year you receive the bonus or royalty \nand any later tax years until the depletion you \nwould have deducted equals the exploration \ncosts you deducted.\nGenerally, if you dispose of the mine before \nyou have fully recaptured the exploration costs \nyou deducted, recapture the balance by treating \nall or part of your gain as ordinary income.

If your gain is more than your \nadjusted exploration costs, treat as ordinary in-\ncome only a part of your gain, up to the amount \nof your adjusted exploration costs.\nForeign exploration costs.  If you pay or incur \nexploration costs for a mine or other natural de-\nposit located outside the United States, you \ncannot deduct all the costs in the current year. \nYou can elect to include the costs (other than \nfor an oil, gas, or geothermal well) in the adjus-\nted basis of the mineral property to figure cost \ndepletion. (Cost depletion is discussed in chap-\nter 9 .) If you do not make this election, you must \ndeduct the costs over the 10 -year period begin-\nning with the tax year in which you pay or incur \nthem. These rules also apply to foreign devel-\nopment costs.\nDevelopment Costs\nYou can deduct costs paid or incurred during \nthe tax year for developing a mine or any other \nnatural deposit (other than an oil or gas well) lo-\ncated in the United States. These costs must be \npaid or incurred after the discovery of ores or \nminerals in commercially marketable quantities. \nDevelopment costs also include depreciation \non improvements used in the development of \nores or minerals and costs incurred for you by a \ncontractor. Development costs do not include \nthe costs for the acquisition or improvement of \ndepreciable property.\nInstead of deducting development costs in \nthe year paid or incurred, you can elect to treat \nthe costs as deferred expenses and deduct \nthem ratably as the units of produced ores or \nminerals benefited by the expenses are sold. \nThis election applies each tax year to expenses \npaid or incurred in that year. Once made, the \nelection is binding for the year and cannot be \nrevoked for any reason.\nHow to make the election.  The election to \ndeduct development costs ratably as the ores \nor minerals are sold must be made for each \nmine or other natural deposit by a clear indica-\ntion on your return or by a statement filed with \nthe IRS office where you file your return. Gener-\nally, you must make the election by the due \ndate of the return (including extensions).

The rules dis-\ncussed earlier for Foreign exploration costs  ap-\nply to foreign development costs.\nReduced corporate deductions for develop-\nment costs.  The rules discussed earlier for \nReduced corporate deductions for exploration \ncosts  also apply to corporate deductions for de-\nvelopment costs.Circulation Costs\nA publisher can deduct as a current business \nexpense the costs of establishing, maintaining, \nor increasing the circulation of a newspaper, \nmagazine, or other periodical. For example, a \npublisher can deduct the cost of hiring extra \nemployees for a limited time to get new sub-\nscriptions through telephone calls. Circulation \ncosts may be deducted even if they would nor-\nmally be capitalized.\nThis rule does not apply to the following \ncosts that must be capitalized.\n\u2022The purchase of land or depreciable prop-\nerty.\n\u2022The acquisition of circulation through the \npurchase of any part of the business of an-\nother publisher of a newspaper, magazine, \nor other periodical, including the purchase \nof another publisher's list of subscribers.\nOther treatment of circulation costs.  If you \ndo not want to deduct circulation costs as a cur-\nrent business expense, you can elect one of the \nfollowing ways to recover these costs.\n\u2022Capitalize all circulation costs that are \nproperly chargeable to a capital account \n(see chapter 1 ).\n\u2022Amortize circulation costs over the 3-year \nperiod beginning with the tax year they \nwere paid or incurred.\nHow to make the election.  You elect to capi-\ntalize circulation costs by attaching a statement \nto your return for the first tax year the election \napplies. Your election is binding for the year it is \nmade and for all later years, unless you get IRS \napproval to revoke it.\nBusiness Startup and \nOrganizational Costs\nBusiness startup and organizational costs are \ngenerally capital expenditures. However, you \ncan elect to deduct up to $5,000 of business \nstartup and $5,000 of organizational costs paid \nor incurred after October 22, 2004. The $5,000 \ndeduction is reduced by the amount your total \nstartup or organizational costs exceed $50,000. \nAny remaining costs must be amortized. For in-\nformation about amortizing startup and organi-\nzational costs, see chapter 8 .\nStartup costs include any amounts paid or \nincurred in connection with creating an active \ntrade or business or investigating the creation \nor acquisition of an active trade or business. Or-\nganizational costs include the costs of creating \na corporation or partnership.\nHow to make the election.  You elect to de-\nduct the startup or organizational costs by \nclaiming the deduction on your income tax re-\nturn (filed by the due date including extensions) \nfor the tax year in which the active trade or busi-\nness begins. For costs paid or incurred after \nSeptember 8, 2008, you are not required to at-\ntach a statement to your return to elect to de-\nduct such costs. However, for startup or organi-\nzational costs paid or incurred before \nSeptember 9, 2008, you may be required to at-tach a statement to your return to elect to de-\nduct such costs.

For more in-\nformation on startup and organizational costs, \nsee chapter 8 .\nReforestation Costs\nReforestation costs are generally capital expen-\nditures. However, you can elect to deduct up to \n$10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately; $0 \nfor a trust) of qualifying reforestation costs paid \nor incurred after October 22, 2004, for each \nqualified timber property. The remaining costs \ncan be amortized over an 84 -month period. For \ninformation about amortizing reforestation \ncosts, see chapter 8 .\nQualifying reforestation costs are the direct \ncosts of planting or seeding for forestation or re-\nforestation. Qualified timber property is property \nthat contains trees in significant commercial \nquantities. See chapter 8  for more information \non qualifying reforestation costs and qualified \ntimber property.\nIf you elect to deduct qualified reforestation \ncosts, create and maintain separate timber ac-\ncounts for each qualified timber property and in-\nclude all reforestation costs and the dates each \nwas applied. Do not include this qualified timber \nproperty in any account (for example, depletion \nblock) for which depletion is allowed.\nHow to make the election.  You elect to de-\nduct qualifying reforestation costs by claiming \nthe deduction on your timely filed income tax re-\nturn (including extensions) for the tax year the \nexpenses were paid or incurred. If Form T (Tim-\nber) is required, complete Part IV of the form.

This deduction may have to be re-\ncaptured as ordinary income under section \n1245 when you sell or otherwise dispose of the \nproperty that would have received an addition \nto basis if you had not elected to deduct the ex-\npenditure. For more information on recapturing \nthe deduction, see Depreciation Recapture  in \nPub. 544.\nRetired Asset Removal \nCosts\nIf you retire and remove a depreciable asset in \nconnection with the installation or production of \na replacement asset, you can deduct the costs \nof removing the retired asset. However, if you \nreplace a component (part) of a depreciable as-\nset, capitalize the removal costs if the replace-\nment is an improvement and deduct the costs if \nthe replacement is a repair.\nBarrier Removal Costs\nThe cost of an improvement to a business asset \nis normally a capital expense. However, you \ncan elect to deduct the costs of making a facility \nor public transportation vehicle more accessible \nto and usable by those who are disabled or eld-\nerly. You must own or lease the facility or vehi-\ncle for use in connection with your trade or busi-\nness.\nA facility is all or any part of buildings, struc-\ntures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or \nsimilar real or personal property. A public trans-\nportation vehicle is a vehicle, such as a bus or \nrailroad car, that provides transportation service \nto the public (including service for your custom-\ners, even if you are not in the business of pro-\nviding transportation services).\nYou cannot deduct any costs that you paid \nor incurred to completely renovate or build a fa-\ncility or public transportation vehicle or to re-\nplace depreciable property in the normal course \nof business.\nDeduction limit.  The most you can deduct as \na cost of removing barriers to the disabled and \nthe elderly for any tax year is $15,000. How-\never, you can add any costs over this limit to the \nbasis of the property and depreciate these ex-\ncess costs.\nPartners and partnerships.  The $15,000 limit \napplies to a partnership and also to each part-\nner in the partnership. A partner can allocate \nthe $15,000 limit in any manner among the part-\nner's individually incurred costs and the part-\nner's distributive share of partnership costs. If \nthe partner cannot deduct the entire share of \npartnership costs, the partnership can add any \ncosts not deducted to the basis of the improved \nproperty.\nA partnership must be able to show that any \namount added to basis was not deducted by \nthe partner and that it was over a partner's \n$15,000 limit (as determined by the partner). If \nthe partnership cannot show this, it is presumed that the partner was able to deduct the distribu-\ntive share of the partnership's costs in full.\nExample. Emilio Azul's distributive share of \nABC partnership's deductible expenses for the \nremoval of architectural barriers was $14,000. \nEmilio had $12,000 of similar expenses in his \nsole proprietorship. He elected to deduct \n$7,000 of them. Emilio allocated the remaining \n$8,000 of the $15,000 limit to his share of \nABC's expenses. Emilio can add the excess \n$5,000 of his own expenses to the basis of the \nproperty used in his business. Also, if ABC can \nshow that Emilio could not deduct $6,000 \n($14,000 \u2013 $8,000) of his share of the partner-\nship's expenses because of how Emilio applied \nthe limit, ABC can add $6,000 to the basis of its \nproperty.\nQualification standards.  You can deduct \nyour costs as a current expense only if the bar-\nrier removal meets the guidelines and require-\nments issued by the Architectural and Trans-\nportation Barriers Compliance Board under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. \nYou can view the ADA at ADA.gov/pubs/\nada.htm .\nThe following is a list of some architectural \nbarrier removal costs that can be deducted.\n\u2022Ground and floor surfaces.\n\u2022Walks.\n\u2022Parking lots.\n\u2022Ramps.\n\u2022Entrances.\n\u2022Doors and doorways.\n\u2022Stairs.\n\u2022Floors.\n\u2022Toilet rooms.\n\u2022Water fountains.\n\u2022Public telephones.\n\u2022Elevators.\n\u2022Controls.\n\u2022Signage.\n\u2022Alarms.\n\u2022Protruding objects.\n\u2022Symbols of accessibility.\nYou can find the ADA guidelines and require-\nments for architectural barrier removal at \nUSDOJ.gov/crt/ada/reg3a.html .\nThe costs for removal of transportation barri-\ners from rail facilities, buses, and rapid and light \nrail vehicles are deductible. You can find the \nguidelines and requirements for transportation \nbarrier removal at transit.dot.gov .\nAlso, you can access the ADA website at \nADA.gov  for additional information.\nOther barrier removals.  To be deductible, \nexpenses of removing any barrier not covered \nby the above standards must meet all three of \nthe following tests.\n1.The removed barrier must be a substantial \nbarrier to access or use of a facility or pub-\nlic transportation vehicle by persons who \nhave a disability or are elderly.\n2.The removed barrier must have been a \nbarrier for at least one major group of per-\nsons who have a disability or are elderly \n(such as people who are blind, deaf, or \nwheelchair users).3.The barrier must be removed without cre-\nating any new barrier that significantly im-\npairs access to or use of the facility or ve-\nhicle by a major group of persons who \nhave a disability or are elderly.\nHow to make the election.  If you elect to de-\nduct your costs for removing barriers to the dis-\nabled or the elderly, claim the deduction on \nyour income tax return (partnership return for \npartnerships) for the tax year the expenses \nwere paid or incurred. Identify the deduction as \na separate item. The election applies to all the \nqualifying costs you have during the year, up to \nthe $15,000 limit. If you make this election, you \nmust maintain adequate records to support your \ndeduction.\nFor your election to be valid, you must gen-\nerally file your return by its due date, including \nextensions. However, if you timely filed your re-\nturn for the year without making the election, \nyou can still make the election by filing an \namended return within 6 months of the due date \nof the return (excluding extensions).

See Research and Experimental \nCosts , later.\nIntroduction\nAmortization is a method of recovering (deduct-\ning) certain capital costs over a fixed period of \ntime. It is similar to the straight line method of \ndepreciation.\nThe various amortizable costs covered in \nthis chapter are included in the list below. How-\never, this chapter doesn't discuss amortization \nof bond premium. For information on that topic, \nsee chapter 3 of Pub. 550, Investment Expen-\nses.Topics\nThis chapter discusses:\n\u2022Deducting amortization\n\u2022Amortizing costs of starting a business\n\u2022Amortizing costs of getting a lease\n\u2022Amortizing costs of section 197 intangibles\n\u2022Amortizing reforestation costs\n\u2022Amortizing costs of geological and \ngeophysical costs\n\u2022Amortizing costs of pollution control \nfacilities\n\u2022Amortizing costs of research and \nexperimentation\n\u2022Amortizing costs of certain tax preferences\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\nPublication\n544 Sales and Other Dispositions of \nAssets\n550 Investment Income and Expenses\n946 How To Depreciate Property\nForm (and Instructions)\n3115 Application for Change in \nAccounting Method\n4562 Depreciation and Amortization\n6251 Alternative Minimum \nTax\u2014Individuals\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nHow To Deduct \nAmortization\nTo deduct amortization that begins during the \ncurrent tax year, complete Part VI of Form 4562 \nand attach it to your income tax return.\nTo report amortization from previous years, \nin addition to amortization that begins in the cur-\nrent year, list on Form 4562 each item sepa-\nrately. For example, in 2021, you began to am-\nortize a lease. In 2022, you began to amortize a \nsecond lease. Report amortization from the new \nlease on line 42 of your 2022 Form 4562. Re-\nport amortization from the 2021 lease on line 43 \nof your 2022 Form 4562.\nIf you don't have any new amortizable ex-\npenses for the current year, you aren't required \nto complete Form 4562 (unless you are claim-\ning depreciation). Report the current year's de-\nduction for amortization that began in a prior \nyear directly on the \u201cOther deduction\u201d or \u201cOther \nexpense\u201d line of your return.\nStarting a Business\nWhen you start a business, treat all eligible \ncosts you incur before you begin operating the \nbusiness as capital expenditures that are part of \nyour basis in the business. Generally, you re-\ncover costs for particular assets through depre-\nciation deductions. However, you generally   544 \n  550 \n  946 \n  3115 \n  4562 \n  6251 can't recover other costs until you sell the busi-\nness or otherwise go out of business. For a dis-\ncussion on how to treat these costs, see If your \nattempt to go into business is unsuccessful  un-\nder Capital Expenses  in chapter 1 .\nFor costs paid or incurred after September \n8, 2008, you can deduct a limited amount of \nstartup and organizational costs. The costs that \naren't deducted currently can be amortized rat-\nably over a 180 -month period. The amortization \nperiod starts with the month you begin operat-\ning your active trade or business. You aren't re-\nquired to attach a statement to make this elec-\ntion. You can choose to forgo this election by \naffirmatively electing to capitalize your startup \ncosts on your income tax return filed by the due \ndate (including extensions) for the tax year in \nwhich the active trade or business begins. Once \nmade, the election to either amortize or capital-\nize startup costs is irrevocable and applies to all \nstartup costs that are related to your trade or \nbusiness. See Regulations sections 1. 195-1, \n1.248-1, and 1.709-1.\nFor costs paid or incurred after October 22, \n2004, and before September 9, 2008, you can \nelect to deduct a limited amount of business \nstartup and organizational costs in the year your \nactive trade or business begins. Any costs not \ndeducted can be amortized ratably over a \n180- month period, beginning with the month \nyou begin business. If the election is made, you \nmust attach any statement required by Regula-\ntions sections 1. 195- 1(b), 1. 248- 1(c), and \n1.709- 1(c), as in effect before September 9, \n2008.\nNote.  You can apply the provisions of Reg-\nulations sections 1. 195- 1, 1. 248- 1, and 1. 709-1 \nto all business startup and organizational costs \npaid or incurred after October 22, 2004, provi-\nded the period of limitations on assessment \nhasn't expired for the year of the election. Oth-\nerwise, for business startup and organizational \ncosts paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, \nand before September 9, 2008, the provisions \nunder Regulations sections 1. 195-1(b), \n1.248- 1(c), and 1. 709- 1(c), as in effect before \nSeptember 9, 2008, will apply.\nFor costs paid or incurred before October \n23, 2004, you can elect to amortize business \nstartup and organizational costs over an amorti-\nzation period of 60 months or more. See How \nTo Make the Election , later.\nThe cost must qualify as one of the follow-\ning.\n\u2022A business startup cost.\n\u2022An organizational cost for a corporation.\n\u2022An organizational cost for a partnership.\nBusiness Startup Costs\nStartup costs are amounts paid or incurred for \n(a) creating an active trade or business, or (b) \ninvestigating the creation or acquisition of an \nactive trade or business. Startup costs include \namounts paid or incurred in connection with an \nexisting activity engaged in for profit, and for the \nproduction of income in anticipation of the activ-\nity becoming an active trade or business.Page 29 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

        "content": "Qualifying costs.  A startup cost is amortiza-\nble if it meets both of the following tests.\n\u2022It is a cost you could deduct if you paid or \nincurred it to operate an existing active \ntrade or business (in the same field as the \none you entered into).\n\u2022It is a cost you pay or incur before the day \nyour active trade or business begins.\nStartup costs include amounts paid for the \nfollowing.\n\u2022An analysis or survey of potential markets, \nproducts, labor supply, transportation fa-\ncilities, etc.\n\u2022Advertisements for the opening of the busi-\nness.\n\u2022Salaries and wages for employees who are \nbeing trained and their instructors.\n\u2022Travel and other necessary costs for se-\ncuring prospective distributors, suppliers, \nor customers.\n\u2022Salaries and fees for executives and con-\nsultants, or for similar professional serv-\nices.\nNonqualifying costs.  Startup costs don't in-\nclude deductible interest, taxes, or research \nand experimental costs. See Research and Ex-\nperimental Costs , later.\nPurchasing an active trade or business. \nAmortizable startup costs for purchasing an ac-\ntive trade or business include only investigative \ncosts incurred in the course of a general search \nfor or preliminary investigation of the business. \nThese are costs that help you decide whether \nto purchase a business. Costs you incur in an \nattempt to purchase a specific business are \ncapital expenses that you can't amortize.\nExample.  On June 1, you hired an ac-\ncounting firm and a law firm to assist you in the \npotential purchase of XYZ, Inc. They re-\nsearched XYZ's industry and analyzed the fi-\nnancial projections of XYZ, Inc. In September, \nthe law firm prepared and submitted a letter of \nintent to XYZ, Inc. The letter stated that a bind-\ning commitment would result only after a pur-\nchase agreement was signed. The law firm and \naccounting firm continued to provide services, \nincluding a review of XYZ's books and records \nand the preparation of a purchase agreement. \nOn October 22, you signed a purchase agree-\nment with XYZ, Inc.\nAll amounts paid or incurred to investigate \nthe business before October 22 are amortizable \ninvestigative costs. Amounts paid on or after \nthat date relate to the attempt to purchase the \nbusiness and therefore must be capitalized.\nDisposition of business.  If you completely \ndispose of your business before the end of the \namortization period, you can deduct any re-\nmaining deferred startup costs. However, you \ncan deduct these deferred startup costs only to \nthe extent they qualify as a loss from a busi-\nness.\nCosts of Organizing a \nCorporation\nAmounts paid to organize a corporation are the \ndirect costs of creating the corporation.Qualifying costs.  To qualify as an organiza-\ntional cost, it must be:\n\u2022For the creation of the corporation,\n\u2022Chargeable to a capital account (see chap-\nter 1 ),\n\u2022Amortized over the life of the corporation if \nthe corporation had a fixed life, and\n\u2022Incurred before the end of the first tax year \nin which the corporation is in business.\nA corporation using the cash method of ac-\ncounting can amortize organizational costs in-\ncurred within the first tax year, even if it doesn't \npay them in that year.\nExamples of organizational costs include \nthe following.\n\u2022The cost of temporary directors.\n\u2022The cost of organizational meetings.\n\u2022State incorporation fees.\n\u2022The cost of legal services.\nNonqualifying costs.  The following items are \ncapital expenses that can't be amortized.\n\u2022Costs for issuing and selling stock or se-\ncurities, such as commissions, professio-\nnal fees, and printing costs.\n\u2022Costs associated with the transfer of as-\nsets to the corporation.\nCosts of Organizing a \nPartnership\nThe costs to organize a partnership are the di-\nrect costs of creating the partnership.\nQualifying costs.  A partnership can amortize \nan organizational cost only if it meets all the fol-\nlowing tests.\n\u2022It is for the creation of the partnership and \nnot for starting or operating the partnership \ntrade or business.\n\u2022It is chargeable to a capital account (see \nchapter 1 ).\n\u2022It could be amortized over the life of the \npartnership if the partnership had a fixed \nlife.\n\u2022It is incurred by the due date of the partner-\nship return (excluding extensions) for the \nfirst tax year in which the partnership is in \nbusiness. However, if the partnership uses \nthe cash method of accounting and pays \nthe cost after the end of its first tax year, \nsee Cash method partnership  under How \nTo Amortize , later.\n\u2022It is for a type of item normally expected to \nbenefit the partnership throughout its entire \nlife.\nOrganizational costs include the following \nfees.\n\u2022Legal fees for services incident to the or-\nganization of the partnership, such as ne-\ngotiation and preparation of the partner-\nship agreement.\n\u2022Accounting fees for services incident to the \norganization of the partnership.\n\u2022Filing fees.\nNonqualifying costs.  The following costs \ncan't be amortized.\n\u2022The cost of acquiring assets for the part-\nnership or transferring assets to the part-\nnership.\u2022The cost of admitting or removing partners, \nother than at the time the partnership is \nfirst organized.\n\u2022The cost of making a contract concerning \nthe operation of the partnership trade or \nbusiness, including a contract between a \npartner and the partnership.\n\u2022The costs for issuing and marketing inter-\nests in the partnership such as brokerage, \nregistration, and legal fees and printing \ncosts. These \u201csyndication fees\u201d are capital \nexpenses that can't be depreciated or \namortized.\nLiquidation of partnership.  If a partnership \nis liquidated before the end of the amortization \nperiod, the unamortized amount of qualifying or-\nganizational costs can be deducted in the part-\nnership's final tax year. However, these costs \ncan be deducted only to the extent they qualify \nas a loss from a business.\nHow To Amortize\nDeduct startup and organizational costs in \nequal amounts over the applicable amortization \nperiod (discussed earlier under Business \nStartup Costs ). You can choose an amortization \nperiod for startup costs that is different from the \nperiod you choose for organizational costs, as \nlong as both aren't less than the applicable am-\nortization period. Once you choose an amorti-\nzation period, you can't change it.\nTo figure your deduction, divide your total \nstartup or organizational costs by the months in \nthe amortization period. The result is the \namount you can deduct for each month.\nCash method partnership.  A partnership us-\ning the cash method of accounting can deduct \nan organizational cost only if it has been paid by \nthe end of the tax year. However, any cost the \npartnership could have deducted as an organi-\nzational cost in an earlier tax year (if it had been \npaid that year) can be deducted in the tax year \nof payment.\nHow To Make the Election\nTo elect to amortize startup or organizational \ncosts, you must complete and attach Form \n4562 to your return for the first tax year you are \nin business. You may also be required to attach \nan organizational costs election statement  (de-\nscribed later) to your return.\nFor startup or organizational costs paid or \nincurred after September 8, 2008, an accompa-\nnying statement isn't required. Generally, for \nstartup or organizational costs paid or incurred \nbefore September 9, 2008, and after October \n22, 2004, unless you choose to apply Regula-\ntions sections 1. 195- 1, 1. 248- 1, and 1. 709-1, \nyou must also attach an accompanying state-\nment to elect to amortize the costs.\nIf you have both startup and organizational \ncosts, attach a separate statement (if required) \nto your return for each type of cost. See Starting \na Business , earlier, for more information.\nGenerally, you must file the return by the \ndue date (including any extensions).

If \nyou elect to amortize your corporation's or part-\nnership's organizational costs, attach a sepa-\nrate statement (if required) that contains the fol-\nlowing information.\n\u2022A description of each cost.\n\u2022The amount of each cost.\n\u2022The date each cost was incurred.\u2022The month your corporation or partnership \nbegan active business (or acquired the \nbusiness).\n\u2022The number of months in your amortization \nperiod (which is generally 180 months).\nPartnerships.  The statement prepared for \na cash basis partnership must also indicate the \namount paid before the end of the year for each \ncost.\nYou don't need to separately list any part-\nnership organizational cost that is less than \n$10. Instead, you can list the total amount of \nthese costs with the dates the first and last \ncosts were incurred.\nAfter a partnership makes the election to \namortize organizational costs, it can later file an \namended return to include additional organiza-\ntional costs not included in the partnership's \noriginal return and statement.\nGetting a Lease\nIf you get a lease for business property, you \nmay recover the cost of acquiring the lease by \namortizing it over the term of the lease. The \nterm of the lease for amortization purposes gen-\nerally includes all renewal options (and any \nother period for which you and the lessor rea-\nsonably expect the lease to be renewed). How-\never, renewal periods aren't included if 75% or \nmore of the cost of acquiring the lease is for the \nterm of the lease remaining on the acquisition \ndate (not including any period for which you \nmay choose to renew, extend, or continue the \nlease).\nFor more information on the costs of getting \na lease, see Cost of Getting a Lease  in\nchapter 3 .\nHow to amortize.  Enter your deduction in \nPart VI of Form 4562 if you are deducting amor-\ntization that begins during the current year, or \non the appropriate line of your tax return if you \naren't otherwise required to file Form 4562.\nSection 197 Intangibles\nGenerally, you may amortize the capitalized \ncosts of \u201csection 197 intangibles\u201d (see Section \n197 Intangibles Defined , later) ratably over a \n15-year period. You must amortize these costs \nif you hold the section 197 intangibles in con-\nnection with your trade or business or in an ac-\ntivity engaged in for the production of income.\nYou may not be able to amortize sec-\ntion 197 intangibles acquired in a trans-\naction that didn't result in a significant \nchange in ownership or use. See Anti-Churning \nRules , later.\nYour amortization deduction each year is \nthe applicable part of the intangible's adjusted \nbasis (for purposes of determining gain), fig-\nured by amortizing it ratably over 15 years (180 \nmonths). The 15 -year period begins with the \nlater of:\n\u2022The month the intangible is acquired, or\n\u2022The month the trade or business or activity \nengaged in for the production of income \nbegins.\nCAUTION!You can't deduct amortization for the month you \ndispose of the intangible.\nIf you pay or incur an amount that increases \nthe basis of an amortizable section 197 intangi-\nble after the 15 -year period begins, amortize it \nover the remainder of the 15 -year period begin-\nning with the month the basis increase occurs.\nYou aren't allowed any other depreciation or \namortization deduction for an amortizable sec-\ntion 197 intangible.\nTax-exempt use property subject to a lease. \nThe amortization period for any section 197 in-\ntangible leased under a lease agreement en-\ntered into after March 12, 2004, to a tax -exempt \norganization, governmental unit, or foreign per-\nson or entity (other than a partnership), shall not \nbe less than 125% of the lease term.\nCost attributable to other property.  The \nrules for section 197 intangibles don't apply to \nany amount that is included in determining the \ncost of property that isn't a section 197 intangi-\nble. For example, if the cost of computer soft-\nware isn't separately stated from the cost of \nhardware or other tangible property and you \nconsistently treat it as part of the cost of the \nhardware or other tangible property, these rules \ndon't apply. Similarly, none of the cost of acquir-\ning real property held for the production of \nrental income is considered the cost of good-\nwill, going concern value, or any other section \n197 intangible.\nSection 197 Intangibles \nDefined\nThe following assets are section 197 intangibles \nand must be amortized over 180 months.\n1.Goodwill.\n2.Going concern value.\n3.Workforce in place.\n4.Business books and records, operating \nsystems, or any other information base, in-\ncluding lists or other information concern-\ning current or prospective customers.\n5.A patent, copyright, formula, process, de-\nsign, pattern, know-how, format, or similar \nitem.\n6.A customer-based intangible.\n7.A supplier-based intangible.\n8.Any item similar to items 3 through 7.\n9.A license, permit, or other right granted by \na governmental unit or agency (including \nissuances and renewals).\n10. A covenant not to compete entered into in \nconnection with the acquisition of an inter-\nest in a trade or business.\n11. Any franchise, trademark, or trade name.\n12. A contract for the use of, or a term interest \nin, any item in this list.Page 31 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

This is the value of a trade or busi-\nness based on expected continued customer \npatronage due to its name, reputation, or any \nother factor.\nGoing concern value.  This is the additional \nvalue of a trade or business that attaches to \nproperty because the property is an integral \npart of an ongoing business activity. It includes \nvalue based on the ability of a business to con-\ntinue to function and generate income even \nthough there is a change in ownership (but \ndoesn't include any other section 197 intangi-\nble). It also includes value based on the imme-\ndiate use or availability of an acquired trade or \nbusiness, such as the use of earnings during \nany period in which the business wouldn't other-\nwise be available or operational.\nWorkforce in place, etc.  This includes the \ncomposition of a workforce (for example, its ex-\nperience, education, or training). It also includes \nthe terms and conditions of employment, \nwhether contractual or otherwise, and any other \nvalue placed on employees or any of their at-\ntributes.\nFor example, you must amortize the part of \nthe purchase price of a business that is for the \nexistence of a highly skilled workforce. Also, \nyou must amortize the cost of acquiring an ex-\nisting employment contract or relationship with \nemployees or consultants.\nBusiness books and records, etc.  This in-\ncludes the intangible value of technical man-\nuals, training manuals or programs, data files, \nand accounting or inventory control systems. It \nalso includes the cost of customer lists; sub-\nscription lists; insurance expirations; patient or \nclient files; and lists of newspaper, magazine, \nradio, and television advertisers.\nPatents, copyrights, etc.  This includes pack-\nage design, computer software, and any inter-\nest in a film, sound recording, videotape, book, \nor other similar property, except as discussed \nlater under Assets That Aren't Section 197 In-\ntangibles .\nCustomer- based intangible.  This is the \ncomposition of market, market share, and any \nother value resulting from the future provision of \ngoods or services because of relationships with \ncustomers in the ordinary course of business. \nFor example, you must amortize the part of the \npurchase price of a business that is for the exis-\ntence of the following intangibles.\n\u2022A customer base.\n\u2022A circulation base.\n\u2022An undeveloped market or market growth.\n\u2022Insurance in force.\n\u2022A mortgage servicing contract.\n\u2022An investment management contract.\n\u2022Any other relationship with customers in-\nvolving the future provision of goods or \nservices.\nCAUTION!Accounts receivable or other similar rights to \nincome for goods or services provided to cus-\ntomers before the acquisition of a trade or busi-\nness aren't section 197 intangibles.\nSupplier- based intangible.  A supplier -based \nintangible is the value resulting from the future \nacquisitions (through contract or other relation-\nships with suppliers in the ordinary course of \nbusiness) of goods or services that you will sell \nor use. The amount you pay or incur for sup-\nplier- based intangibles includes, for example, \nany portion of the purchase price of an acquired \ntrade or business that is attributable to the exis-\ntence of a favorable relationship with persons \nproviding distribution services (such as a favor-\nable shelf or display space or a retail outlet), or \nthe existence of favorable supply contracts. \nDon't include any amount required to be paid \nfor the goods or services to honor the terms of \nthe agreement or other relationship. Also, see \nAssets That Aren't Section 197 Intangibles , \nlater.\nGovernment- granted license, permit, etc. \nThis is any right granted by a governmental unit \nor an agency or instrumentality of a governmen-\ntal unit. For example, you must amortize the \ncapitalized costs of acquiring (including issuing \nor renewing) a liquor license, a taxicab medal-\nlion or license, or a television or radio broad-\ncasting license.\nCovenant not to compete.  Section 197 intan-\ngibles include a covenant not to compete (or \nsimilar arrangement) entered into in connection \nwith the acquisition of an interest in a trade or \nbusiness, or a substantial portion of a trade or \nbusiness. An interest in a trade or business in-\ncludes an interest in a partnership or a corpora-\ntion engaged in a trade or business.\nAn arrangement that requires the former \nowner to perform services (or to provide prop-\nerty or the use of property) isn't similar to a cov-\nenant not to compete to the extent the amount \npaid under the arrangement represents reason-\nable compensation for those services or for that \nproperty or its use.\nFranchise, trademark, or trade name.  A \nfranchise, trademark, or trade name is a section \n197 intangible. You must amortize its purchase \nor renewal costs, other than certain contingent \npayments that you can deduct currently. For in-\nformation on currently deductible contingent \npayments, see chapter 11 .\nProfessional sports franchise.  A fran-\nchise engaged in professional sports and any \nintangible assets acquired in connection with \nacquiring the franchise (including player con-\ntracts) is a section 197 intangible amortizable \nover a 15-year period.\nContract for the use of, or a term interest in, \na section 197 intangible.  Section 197 intan-\ngibles include any right under a license, con-\ntract, or other arrangement providing for the use \nof any section 197 intangible. It also includes \nany term interest in any section 197 intangible, \nwhether the interest is outright or in trust.Assets That Aren't Section \n197 Intangibles\nThe following assets aren't section 197 intangi-\nbles.\n1.Any interest in a corporation, partnership, \ntrust, or estate.\n2.Any interest under an existing futures con-\ntract, foreign currency contract, notional \nprincipal contract, interest rate swap, or \nsimilar financial contract.\n3.Any interest in land.\n4.Most computer software.

(See Rights of fixed \nduration or amount , later.)\n6.An interest under either of the following.\na.An existing lease or sublease of tangi-\nble property.\nb.A debt that was in existence when the \ninterest was acquired.\n7.A right to service residential mortgages \nunless the right is acquired in connection \nwith the acquisition of a trade or business \nor a substantial part of a trade or business.\n8.Certain transaction costs incurred by par-\nties to a corporate organization or reorgan-\nization in which any part of a gain or loss \nisn't recognized.\nIntangible property that isn't amortizable un-\nder the rules for section 197 intangibles can be \ndepreciated if it meets certain requirements. \nYou must generally use the straight line method \nover its useful life. For certain intangibles, the \ndepreciation period is specified in the law and \nregulations. For example, the depreciation pe-\nriod for computer software that isn't a section \n197 intangible is generally 36 months.\nFor more information on depreciating intan-\ngible property, see Intangible Property  under \nWhat Method Can You Use To Depreciate Your \nProperty?  in chapter 1 of Pub. 946.\nComputer software.

This applies only if \nthe transaction in which you granted the \nright and the transaction in which you ac-\nquired the intangible are part of a series of \nrelated transactions. See Related person , \nlater, for more information.\nExceptions.  The anti -churning rules don't ap-\nply in the following situations.\n\u2022You acquired the intangible from a dece-\ndent and its basis was stepped up to its fair \nmarket value.\n\u2022The intangible was amortizable as a sec-\ntion 197 intangible by the seller or trans-\nferor you acquired it from. This exception \ndoesn't apply if the transaction in which \nyou acquired the intangible and the trans-\naction in which the seller or transferor ac-\nquired it are part of a series of related \ntransactions.\n\u2022The gain -recognition exception , discussed \nlater, applies.\nRelated person.

In determining \nwhether an individual directly or indirectly owns \nany of the outstanding stock of a corporation, \nthe following rules apply.\nRule 1.  Stock directly or indirectly owned \nby or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or \ntrust is considered owned proportionately by or \nfor its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.\nRule 2.

For purposes of applying Rule 1, 2, \nor 3, treat stock constructively owned by a per-\nson under Rule 1 as actually owned by that per-\nson. Don't treat stock constructively owned by \nan individual under Rule 2 or 3 as owned by the \nindividual for reapplying Rule 2 or 3 to make an-\nother person the constructive owner of the \nstock.Page 33 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

This exception \nto the anti -churning rules applies if the person \nyou acquired the intangible from (the transferor) \nmeets both of the following requirements.\n\u2022That person wouldn't be related to you (as \ndescribed under Related person , earlier) if \nthe 20% test for ownership of stock and \npartnership interests were replaced by a \n50% test.\n\u2022That person chose to recognize gain on \nthe disposition of the intangible and pay in-\ncome tax on the gain at the highest tax \nrate. See chapter 2 of Pub. 544 for infor-\nmation on making this choice.\nIf this exception applies, the anti -churning \nrules apply only to the amount of your adjusted \nbasis in the intangible that is more than the gain \nrecognized by the transferor.\nNotification.  If the person you acquired \nthe intangible from chooses to recognize gain \nunder the rules for this exception, that person \nmust notify you in writing by the due date of the \nreturn on which the choice is made.\nAnti- abuse rule.  You can't amortize any sec-\ntion 197 intangible acquired in a transaction for \nwhich the principal purpose was either of the \nfollowing.\n\u2022To avoid the requirement that the intangi-\nble be acquired after August 10, 1993.\n\u2022To avoid any of the anti-churning rules.\nMore information.  For more information \nabout the anti -churning rules, including addi-\ntional rules for partnerships, see Regulations \nsection 1.197-2(h).\nIncorrect Amount of \nAmortization Deducted\nIf you later discover that you deducted an incor-\nrect amount for amortization for a section 197 \nintangible in any year, you may be able to make \na correction for that year by filing an amended \nreturn. See Amended Return  next. If you aren't \nallowed to make the correction on an amended \nreturn, you can change your accounting method \nto claim the correct amortization. See Changing \nYour Accounting Method , later.\nAmended Return\nIf you deducted an incorrect amount for amorti-\nzation, you can file an amended return to cor-\nrect the following.\n\u2022A mathematical error made in any year.\n\u2022A posting error made in any year.\n\u2022An amortization deduction for a section \n197 intangible for which you haven't adop-\nted a method of accounting.\nWhen to file.  If an amended return is allowed, \nyou must file it by the later of the following \ndates.\n\u20223 years from the date you filed your original \nreturn for the year in which you didn't de-\nduct the correct amount. (A return filed \nearly is considered filed on the due date.)\n\u20222 years from the time you paid your tax for \nthat year.Changing Your Accounting Method\nGenerally, you must get IRS approval to change \nyour method of accounting. File Form 3115 to \nrequest a change to a permissible method of \naccounting for amortization.\nThe following are examples of a change in \nmethod of accounting for amortization.\n\u2022A change in the amortization method, pe-\nriod of recovery, or convention of an amor-\ntizable asset.\n\u2022A change in the accounting for amortizable \nassets from a single asset account to a \nmultiple asset account (pooling), or vice \nversa.\n\u2022A change in the accounting for amortizable \nassets from one type of multiple asset ac-\ncount to a different type of multiple asset \naccount.\nChanges in amortization that aren't a \nchange in method of accounting include the fol-\nlowing.\n\u2022A change in figuring amortization in the tax \nyear in which your use of the asset \nchanges.\n\u2022An adjustment in the useful life of an amor-\ntizable asset.\n\u2022Generally, the making of a late amortiza-\ntion election or the revocation of a timely \nvalid amortization election.\n\u2022Any change in the placed-in-service date \nof an amortizable asset.\nSee Regulations section 1. 446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a) \nfor more information and examples.\nAutomatic approval.  In some instances, you \nmay be able to get automatic approval from the \nIRS to change your method of accounting for \namortization. For a list of automatic accounting \nmethod changes, see the Instructions for Form \n3115. Also, see the Instructions for Form 3115 \nfor more information on getting approval, auto-\nmatic approval procedures, and a list of excep-\ntions to the automatic approval process.\nDisposition of Section 197 \nIntangibles\nA section 197 intangible is treated as deprecia-\nble property used in your trade or business. If \nyou held the intangible for more than 1 year, \nany gain on its disposition, up to the amount of \nallowable amortization, is ordinary income (sec-\ntion 1245 gain). If multiple section 197 intangi-\nbles are disposed of in a single transaction or a \nseries of related transactions, treat all of the \nsection 197 intangibles as if they were a single \nasset for purposes of determining the amount of \ngain that is ordinary income. Any remaining \ngain, or any loss, is a section 1231 gain or loss. \nIf you held the intangible 1 year or less, any \ngain or loss on its disposition is an ordinary gain \nor loss. For more information on ordinary or \ncapital gain or loss on business property, see \nchapter 3 of Pub. 544.\nNondeductible loss.  You can't deduct any \nloss on the disposition or worthlessness of a \nsection 197 intangible that you acquired in the \nsame transaction (or series of related transac-tions) as other section 197 intangibles you still \nhave. Instead, increase the adjusted basis of \neach remaining amortizable section 197 intangi-\nble by a proportionate part of the nondeductible \nloss. Figure the increase by multiplying the non-\ndeductible loss on the disposition of the intangi-\nble by the following fraction.\n\u2022The numerator is the adjusted basis of \neach remaining intangible on the date of \nthe disposition.\n\u2022The denominator is the total adjusted basis \nof all remaining amortizable section 197 in-\ntangibles on the date of the disposition.\nCovenant not to compete.  A covenant not to \ncompete, or similar arrangement, isn't consid-\nered disposed of or worthless before you dis-\npose of your entire interest in the trade or busi-\nness for which you entered into the covenant.\nNonrecognition transfers.  If you acquire a \nsection 197 intangible in a nonrecognition trans-\nfer, you are treated as the transferor with re-\nspect to the part of your adjusted basis in the in-\ntangible that isn't more than the transferor's \nadjusted basis. You amortize this part of the ad-\njusted basis over the intangible's remaining am-\nortization period in the hands of the transferor. \nNonrecognition transfers include transfers to a \ncorporation, partnership contributions and dis-\ntributions, like -kind exchanges, and involuntary \nconversions.\nIn a like -kind exchange or involuntary con-\nversion of a section 197 intangible, you must \ncontinue to amortize the part of your adjusted \nbasis in the acquired intangible that isn't more \nthan your adjusted basis in the exchanged or \nconverted intangible over the remaining amorti-\nzation period of the exchanged or converted in-\ntangible. Amortize over a new 15 -year period \nthe part of your adjusted basis in the acquired \nintangible that is more than your adjusted basis \nin the exchanged or converted intangible.\nExample.  You own a section 197 intangi-\nble you have amortized for 4 full years. It has a \nremaining unamortized basis of $30,000. You \nexchange the asset plus $10,000 for a like -kind \nsection 197 intangible. The nonrecognition pro-\nvisions of like -kind exchanges apply. You amor-\ntize $30,000 of the $40,000 adjusted basis of \nthe acquired intangible over the 11 years re-\nmaining in the original 15 -year amortization pe-\nriod for the transferred asset. You amortize the \nother $10,000 of adjusted basis over a new \n15-year period. For more information, see Reg-\nulations section 1.197-2(g).\nReforestation Costs\nYou can elect to deduct a limited amount of re-\nforestation costs paid or incurred during the tax \nyear. See Reforestation Costs  in chapter 7 . You \ncan elect to amortize the qualifying costs that \naren't deducted currently over an 84 -month pe-\nriod. There is no limit on the amount of your am-\nortization deduction for reforestation costs paid \nor incurred during the tax year.Page 34 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

        "content": "The election to amortize reforestation costs \nincurred by a partnership, S corporation, or es-\ntate must be made by the partnership, corpora-\ntion, or estate. A partner, shareholder, or \nbeneficiary can't make that election.\nA partner's or shareholder's share of amor-\ntizable costs is figured under the general rules \nfor allocating items of income, loss, deduction, \netc., of a partnership or S corporation. The am-\nortizable costs of an estate are divided between \nthe estate and the income beneficiary based on \nthe income of the estate allocable to each.\nQualifying costs.  Reforestation costs are the \ndirect costs of planting or seeding for foresta-\ntion or reforestation. Qualifying costs include \nonly those costs you must capitalize and in-\nclude in the adjusted basis of the property. \nThey include costs for the following items.\n\u2022Site preparation.\n\u2022Seeds or seedlings.\n\u2022Labor.\n\u2022Tools.\n\u2022Depreciation on equipment used in plant-\ning and seeding.\nQualifying costs don't include costs for \nwhich the government reimburses you under a \ncost- sharing program, unless you include the \nreimbursement in your income.\nQualified timber property.  Qualified timber \nproperty is property that contains trees in signif-\nicant commercial quantities. It can be a woodlot \nor other site that you own or lease. The property \nqualifies only if it meets all of the following re-\nquirements.\n\u2022It is located in the United States.\n\u2022It is held for the growing and cutting of tim-\nber you will use in, or sell for use in, the \ncommercial production of timber products.\n\u2022It consists of at least one acre planted with \ntree seedlings in the manner normally used \nin forestation or reforestation.\nQualified timber property doesn't include \nproperty on which you have planted shelter \nbelts or ornamental trees, such as Christmas \ntrees.\nAmortization period.  The 84 -month amorti-\nzation period starts on the first day of the first \nmonth of the second half of the tax year you in-\ncur the costs (July 1 for a calendar year tax-\npayer), regardless of the month you actually in-\ncur the costs. You can claim amortization \ndeductions for no more than 6 months of the \nfirst and last (eighth) tax years of the period.\nLife tenant and remainderman.  If one per-\nson holds the property for life with the remain-\nder going to another person, the life tenant is \nentitled to the full amortization for qualifying re-\nforestation costs incurred by the life tenant. Any \nremainder interest in the property is ignored for \namortization purposes.\nRecapture. If you dispose of qualified timber \nproperty within 10 years after the tax year you \nincur qualifying reforestation expenses, report \nany gain as ordinary income up to the amortiza-\ntion you took. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544 for \nmore information.How to make the election.  To elect to amor-\ntize qualifying reforestation costs, complete Part \nVI of Form 4562 and attach a statement that \ncontains the following information.\n\u2022A description of the costs and the dates \nyou incurred them.\n\u2022A description of the type of timber being \ngrown and the purpose for which it is \ngrown.\nAttach a separate statement for each property \nfor which you amortize reforestation costs.\nGenerally, you must make the election on a \ntimely filed return (including extensions) for the \ntax year in which you incurred the costs. How-\never, if you timely filed your return for the year \nwithout making the election, you can still make \nthe election by filing an amended return within 6 \nmonths of the due date of the return (excluding \nextensions). Attach Form 4562 and the state-\nment to the amended return and write \u201cFiled \npursuant to section 301. 9100- 2\u201d on Form 4562. \nFile the amended return at the same address \nyou filed the original return.\nRevoking the election.  You must get IRS ap-\nproval to revoke your election to amortize quali-\nfying reforestation costs. Your application to re-\nvoke the election must include your name, \naddress, the years for which your election was \nin effect, and your reason for revoking it. Pro-\nvide your daytime telephone number (optional), \nin case we need to contact you. You, or your \nduly authorized representative, must sign the \napplication and file it at least 90 days before the \ndue date (without extensions) for filing your in-\ncome tax return for the first tax year for which \nyour election is to end.\nSend the application to:\nInternal Revenue Service\nAssociate Chief Counsel\nPassthroughs and Special Industries\nCC:PSI:6\n1111 Constitution Ave. NW, IR-5300\nWashington, DC 20224\nGeological and \nGeophysical Costs\nYou can amortize the cost of geological and ge-\nophysical expenses paid or incurred in connec-\ntion with oil and gas exploration or development \nwithin the United States. These costs can be \namortized ratably over a 24 -month period be-\nginning on the midpoint of the tax year in which \nthe expenses were paid or incurred. For major \nintegrated oil companies (as defined in section \n167(h)(5)), these costs must be amortized rata-\nbly over a 7 -year period for costs paid or incur-\nred after December 19, 2007 (a 5 -year period \nfor costs paid or incurred after May 17, 2006, \nand before December 20, 2007).\nIf you retire or abandon the property during \nthe amortization period, no amortization deduc-\ntion is allowed in the year of retirement or aban-\ndonment.\nPollution Control \nFacilities\nYou can elect to amortize the cost of a certified \npollution control facility over 60 months. How-\never, see Atmospheric pollution control facili-\nties, later, for an exception. The cost of a pollu-\ntion control facility that isn't eligible for \namortization can be depreciated under the reg-\nular rules for depreciation. Also, you can claim a \nspecial depreciation allowance on a certified \npollution control facility that is qualified property \neven if you elect to amortize its cost. You must \nreduce its cost (amortizable basis) by the \namount of any special allowance you claim. \nSee chapter 3 of Pub. 946.\nA certified pollution control facility is a new \nidentifiable treatment facility used in connection \nwith a plant or other property in operation be-\nfore 1976 to reduce or control water or atmos-\npheric pollution or contamination. The facility \nmust do so by removing, changing, disposing, \nstoring, or preventing the creation or emission \nof pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat. \nThe facility must be certified by state and fed-\neral certifying authorities.\nThe facility must not significantly increase \nthe output or capacity, extend the useful life, or \nreduce the total operating costs of the plant or \nother property. Also, it must not significantly \nchange the nature of the manufacturing or pro-\nduction process or facility.\nThe federal certifying authority won't certify \nyour property to the extent it appears you will \nrecover (over the property's useful life) all or \npart of its cost from the profit based on its oper-\nation (such as through sales of recovered \nwastes). The federal certifying authority will de-\nscribe the nature of the potential cost recovery. \nYou must then reduce the amortizable basis of \nthe facility by this potential recovery.\nNew identifiable treatment facility.  A \nnew identifiable treatment facility is tangible de-\npreciable property that is identifiable as a treat-\nment facility. It doesn't include a building and its \nstructural components unless the building is ex-\nclusively a treatment facility.\nAtmospheric pollution control facilities. \nCertain atmospheric pollution control facilities \ncan be amortized over 84 months. To qualify, \nthe following must apply.\n\u2022The facility must be acquired and placed in \nservice after April 11, 2005. If acquired, the \noriginal use must begin with you after April \n11, 2005.\n\u2022The facility must be used in connection \nwith an electric generation plant or other \nproperty placed in operation after Decem-\nber 31, 1975, that is primarily coal fired.\n\u2022If you construct, reconstruct, or erect the \nfacility, only the basis attributable to the \nconstruction, reconstruction, or erection \ncompleted after April 11, 2005, qualifies.\nBasis reduction for corporations.  A corpo-\nration must reduce the amortizable basis of a \npollution control facility by 20% before figuring \nthe amortization deduction.Page 35 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

The \ndepletion deduction allows an owner or opera-\ntor to account for the reduction of the mineral \nproperty\u2019s value or basis as a result of the ex-\ntraction of the natural resource.\nThere are two ways of figuring depletion: \ncost depletion and percentage depletion. For oil \nand gas wells, mines, other natural deposits (in-\ncluding geothermal deposits), and mineral \nproperty, you must generally use the method \nthat gives you the larger deduction. For stand-\ning timber, you must use cost depletion.\nTopics\nThis chapter discusses:\n\u2022Who can claim depletion\n\u2022Mineral property\n\u2022Timber\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\nPublication\n544 Sales and Other Dispositions of \nAssets\n551 Basis of Assets\nForm (and Instructions)\nSchedule E (Form 1040) Supplemental \nIncome and Loss\nSchedule K-1 (Form 1065) Partner\u2019s \nShare of Income, Deductions, \nCredits, etc.\nSchedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) \nShareholder's Share of Income, \nDeductions, Credits, etc.\n6198 At-Risk Limitations  544\n  551\n  Schedule E (Form 1040)\n  Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)\n  Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)\n  6198Page 36 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

More than one person \ncan have an economic interest in the same min-\neral deposit or timber. In the case of leased \nproperty, the depletion deduction is divided be-\ntween the lessor and the lessee.\nYou have an economic interest if both the \nfollowing apply.\n\u2022You have acquired by investment any in-\nterest in mineral deposits or standing tim-\nber.\n\u2022You have a legal right to income from the \nextraction of the mineral or cutting of the \ntimber to which you must look for a return \nof your capital investment.\nA contractual relationship that allows you an \neconomic or monetary advantage from prod-\nucts of the mineral deposit or standing timber is \nnot, in itself, an economic interest.\nDepletion is an item of tax preference \nunder the Alternative Minimum Tax \n(AMT). See section 57.\nBasis adjustment for depletion.  You must \nreduce the basis of your property by the deple-\ntion allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, \nbut not below zero.\nMineral Property\nMineral property includes oil and gas wells, \nmines, and other natural deposits (including ge-\nothermal deposits). For this purpose, the term \n\u201cproperty\u201d means each separate interest you \nown in each mineral deposit in each separate \ntract or parcel of land. You can treat two or \nmore separate interests as one property or as \nseparate properties. See section 614 and the \nrelated regulations for rules on how to treat sep-\narate mineral interests.\nThere are two ways of figuring depletion on \nmineral property.\n\u2022Cost depletion.\n\u2022Percentage depletion.\nGenerally, you must use the method that gives \nyou the larger deduction. However, unless you \nare an independent producer or royalty owner, \nyou generally cannot use percentage depletion \nfor oil and gas wells. See Oil and Gas Wells , \nlater.\nCost Depletion\nTo figure cost depletion, you must first deter-\nmine the following.\n\u2022The property's basis for depletion.\n\u2022The total recoverable units of mineral in the \nproperty's natural deposit.  8582\n  T (Timber)\nCAUTION!\u2022The number of units of mineral sold during \nthe tax year.\nBasis for depletion.  To figure the property's \nbasis for depletion, subtract all the following \nfrom the property's adjusted basis.\n1.Amounts recoverable through:\na.Depreciation deductions,\nb.Deferred expenses (including defer-\nred exploration and development \ncosts), and\nc.Deductions other than depletion.\n2.The residual value of land and improve-\nments at the end of operations.\n3.The cost or value of land acquired for pur-\nposes other than mineral production.\nAdjusted basis.  The adjusted basis of \nyour property is your original cost or other ba-\nsis, plus certain additions and improvements, \nand minus certain deductions such as depletion \nallowed or allowable and casualty losses. Your \nadjusted basis can never be less than zero. See \nPub. 551 for more information on adjusted ba-\nsis.\nTotal recoverable units.  The total recovera-\nble units is the sum of the following.\n\u2022The number of units of mineral remaining \nat the end of the year (including units re-\ncovered but not sold).\n\u2022The number of units of mineral sold during \nthe tax year (determined under your \nmethod of accounting, as explained next).\nYou must estimate or determine recoverable \nunits (tons, pounds, ounces, barrels, thousands \nof cubic feet, or other measure) of mineral prod-\nucts using the current industry method and the \nmost accurate and reliable information you can \nobtain. You must include ores and minerals that \nare developed, in sight, blocked out, or as-\nsured. You must also include probable or pro-\nspective ores or minerals that are believed to \nexist based on good evidence. But see Elective \nsafe harbor for owners of oil and gas property , \nlater.\nNumber of units sold during the tax year. \nYou determine the number of units sold during \nthe tax year based on your method of account-\ning. Use the following table to make this deter-\nmination.\nIF you \nuse ...THEN the units sold during \nthe tax year are ...\nthe cash method \nof accountingthe units sold for which you \nreceive payment during the tax \nyear (regardless of the year of \nsale).\nan accrual \nmethod of \naccountingthe units sold based on your \ninventories and method of \naccounting for inventory.\nThe number of units sold during the tax year \ndoes not include any for which depletion deduc-\ntions were allowed or allowable in earlier years.\nFiguring the cost depletion deduction. \nOnce you have figured your property's basis for \ndepletion, the total recoverable units, and the \nnumber of units sold during the tax year, you can figure your cost depletion deduction by tak-\ning the following steps.\nStep Action Result\n 1 Divide your property's\nbasis for depletion by\ntotal recoverable units.Depletion unit.\n 2 Multiply the depletion\nunit by units sold\nduring the tax year.Cost depletion \ndeduction.\nYou must keep accounts for the depletion of \neach property and adjust these accounts each \nyear for units sold and depletion claimed.\nElective safe harbor for owners of oil and \ngas property.  Instead of using the method de-\nscribed earlier to determine the total recovera-\nble units, you can use an elective safe harbor to \ndetermine the property\u2019s recoverable reserves \nfor purposes of figuring cost depletion. If you \nchoose the elective safe harbor, the total recov-\nerable units equal 105% of a property's proved \nreserves (both developed and undeveloped). \nFor details, see Revenue Procedure 2004 -19 \non page 563 of I.R.B. 2004 -10, available at \nIRS.gov/irb/2004-10_IRB#RP-2004-19 .\nTo make the election, attach a statement to \nyour timely filed (including extensions) original \nreturn for the first tax year for which the safe \nharbor is elected. The statement must indicate \nthat you are electing the safe harbor provided \nby Revenue Procedure 2004-19. The election, if \nmade, is effective for the tax year in which it is \nmade and all later years. It cannot be revoked \nfor the tax year in which it is elected, but it may \nbe revoked in a later year. Once revoked, it \ncannot be re-elected for the next 5 years.\nPercentage Depletion\nTo figure percentage depletion, you multiply a \ncertain percentage, specified for each mineral, \nby your gross income from the property during \nthe tax year.\nThe rates to be used and other rules for oil \nand gas wells are discussed later under Inde-\npendent Producers and Royalty Owners  and \nunder Natural Gas Wells . Rates and other rules \nfor percentage depletion of other specific miner-\nals are found later under Mines and Geothermal \nDeposits .\nGross income.  When figuring percentage de-\npletion, subtract from your gross income from \nthe property the following amounts.\n\u2022Any rents or royalties you paid or incurred \nfor the property.\n\u2022The part of any bonus you paid for a lease \non the property allocable to the product \nsold (or that otherwise gives rise to gross \nincome) for the tax year.\nA bonus payment includes amounts you paid as \na lessee to satisfy a production payment re-\ntained by the lessor.\nUse the following fraction to figure the part \nof the bonus you must subtract.\nNo. of units sold in the tax year\nRecoverable units from the property\u00d7Bonus \nPayments\nFor oil and gas wells and geothermal depos-\nits, more information about the definition of Page 37 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

To figure the share of produc-\ntion for your net profits interest, you must first \ndetermine your percentage participation (as \nmeasured by the net profits) in the gross reve-\nnue from the property. To figure this percent-\nage, you divide the income you receive for your \nnet profits interest by the gross revenue from \nthe property. Then multiply the total production \nfrom the property by your percentage participa-\ntion to figure your share of the production.\nExample. Riley owns oil property in which \nFinley owns a 20% net profits interest. During \nthe year, the property produced 10,000 barrels \nof oil, which Riley sold for $200,000.

Gen-\nerally, your depletable oil quantity is 1,000 bar-\nrels. Your depletable natural gas quantity is \n6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of \nbarrels of your depletable oil quantity that you \nchoose to apply. If you claim depletion on both \noil and natural gas, you must reduce your de-\npletable oil quantity (1,000 barrels) by the num-\nber of barrels you use to figure your depletable \nnatural gas quantity.\nExample. You have both oil and natural \ngas production. To figure your depletable natu-\nral gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 bar-\nrels of your 1,000 -barrel depletable oil quantity. \nYour depletable natural gas quantity is 2. 16 mil-\nlion cubic feet of gas (360 \u00d7 6,000). You must \nreduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 bar-\nrels (1,000 \u2013 360).\nIf you have production from marginal wells, \nsee section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable \noil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice \n2022-24, available at IRS.gov/irb/2022-21_IRB .\nBusiness entities and family members. \nYou must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in \nproportion to each business entity's or family \nmember's production of domestic oil or gas for \nthe year.\n\u2022Corporations, trusts, and estates if 50% or \nmore of the beneficial interest is owned by \nthe same or related persons (considering \nonly persons that own at least 5% of the \nbeneficial interest).\n\u2022You and your spouse and minor children.\nA related person is anyone mentioned in the re-\nlated persons discussion under Nondeductible \nloss in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for \npurposes of this allocation, item (1) in that dis-\ncussion includes only an individual, spouse, \nand their minor children.\nControlled group of corporations.  Mem-\nbers of the same controlled group of corpora-\ntions are treated as one taxpayer when figuring \nthe depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They \nshare the depletable quantity. A controlled \ngroup of corporations is defined in section \n1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock \nownership requirement is \u201cmore than 50%\u201d \nrather than \u201cat least 80%,\u201d as described in sec-\ntion 1563(a).\nGross income from the property.  For purpo-\nses of percentage depletion, gross income from \nthe property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is \nthe amount you receive from the sale of the oil \nor gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If \nyou do not sell the oil or gas on the property but \nmanufacture or convert it into a refined product \nbefore sale, or transport it before sale, the gross \nincome from the property is the representative \nmarket or field price (RMFP) of the oil or gas \nbefore conversion or transportation.\nHowever, if you sold gas after you transpor-\nted it from the premises for a price that is lower \nthan the RMFP, determine gross income from \nthe property for percentage depletion purposes \nwithout regard to the RMFP.\nGross income from the property does not in-\nclude lease bonuses, advance royalties, or \nother amounts payable without regard to pro-\nduction from the property.\nAverage daily production exceeds depleta-\nble quantities.  If your average daily produc-\ntion for the year is more than your depletable oil \nor natural gas quantity, figure your allowance for \ndepletion for each domestic oil or natural gas \nproperty as follows.\n1.Figure your average daily production of oil \nor natural gas for the year.\n2.Figure your depletable oil or natural gas \nquantity for the year.\n3.Figure depletion for all oil or natural gas \nproduced from the property using a per-\ncentage depletion rate of 15% (0.15).\n4.Multiply the result figured in (3) by a frac-\ntion, the numerator of which is the result \nfigured in (2) and the denominator of \nwhich is the result figured in (1). This is \nyour depletion allowance for that property \nfor the year.\nTaxable income limit.  If you are an independ-\nent producer or royalty owner of oil and gas, your deduction for percentage depletion is limi-\nted to the smaller of the following.\n\u2022100% of your taxable income from the \nproperty figured without the deduction for \ndepletion and the deduction for qualified \nbusiness income under section 199A. For \na definition of taxable income from the \nproperty, see Taxable income limit , earlier, \nunder Mineral Property .\n\u202265% of your taxable income for the year \nfigured without the deduction for depletion, \nthe deduction for qualified business in-\ncome under section 199A, any net operat-\ning loss carryback to the tax year under \nsection 172, any capital loss carryback to \nthe tax year under section 1212, and in the \ncase of a trust, any distribution to its bene-\nficiary (with certain exceptions).\nYou can carry over to the following year any \namount you cannot deduct because of the \n65%-of-taxable- income limit. Add it to your de-\npletion allowance (before applying any limits) \nfor the following year.\nPartnerships and S Corporations\nGenerally, each partner or S corporation share-\nholder, and not the partnership or S corpora-\ntion, figures the depletion allowance separately. \nEach partner or shareholder must decide \nwhether to use cost or percentage depletion. A \npartner or shareholder using percentage deple-\ntion must apply the 65% -of-taxable- income limit \nusing its taxable income from all sources.\nPartner's or shareholder's adjusted basis. \nThe partnership or S corporation must allocate \nto each partner or shareholder its share of the \nadjusted basis of each oil or gas property held \nby the partnership or S corporation. The part-\nnership or S corporation makes the allocation \nas of the date it acquires the oil or gas property.\nEach partner's share of the adjusted basis of \nthe oil or gas property is generally figured ac-\ncording to that partner's interest in partnership \ncapital. However, in some cases, it is figured \naccording to the partner's interest in partnership \nincome.\nThe partnership or S corporation adjusts the \npartner's or shareholder's share of the adjusted \nbasis of the oil and gas property for any capital \nexpenditures made for the property and for any \nchange in partnership or S corporation inter-\nests.\nRecordkeeping.  Each partner or \nshareholder must separately keep re-\ncords of its share of the adjusted basis \nin each oil and gas property of the partnership \nor S corporation. The partner or shareholder \nmust reduce its applicable adjusted basis by \nthe depletion allowed or allowable on the prop-\nerty each year. The partner or shareholder must \nuse that reduced adjusted basis to figure cost \ndepletion, or its gain or loss, if the partnership \nor S corporation disposes of the property.\nReporting the deduction.  Information that \nyou, as a partner or shareholder, use to figure \nyour depletion deduction on oil and gas proper-\nties is reported by the partnership or S corpora-\ntion on Schedule K -1 (Form 1065) or on Sched-\nule K -1 (Form 1120 -S).

The deple-\ntion deducted on Schedule E is included in fig-\nuring income or loss from rental real estate or \nroyalty properties. The Instructions for Sched-\nule E (Form 1040) explain where to report this \nincome or loss and whether you need to file ei-\nther of the following forms.\n\u2022Form 6198.\n\u2022Form 8582.\nNatural Gas Wells\nYou can use percentage depletion for a well \nthat produces natural gas that is either:\n\u2022Regulated natural gas,\n\u2022Sold under a fixed contract, or\n\u2022Produced from geopressured brine.\nRegulated natural gas. Regulated natural gas \nqualifies for a percentage depletion rate of 22%. \nRegulated natural gas is domestic natural gas \nproduced and sold by the producer before July \n1, 1976, and is regulated by the Federal Power \nCommission. The price for regulated gas can-\nnot be adjusted to reflect any increase in the \nseller\u2019s tax liability because of the repeal of per-\ncentage depletion for gas. Price increases after \nFebruary 1, 1975, are presumed to take the in-\ncrease in tax liability into account unless dem-\nonstrated otherwise by clear and convincing \nevidence.\nNatural gas sold under a fixed contract. \nNatural gas sold under a fixed contract qualifies \nfor a percentage depletion rate of 22%. Natural \ngas sold under a fixed contract is domestic nat-\nural gas sold by the producer under a contract \nthat does not provide for a price increase to re-\nflect any increase in the seller's tax liability be-\ncause of the repeal of percentage depletion for \ngas. The contract must have been in effect from \nFebruary 1, 1975, until the date of sale of the \ngas. Price increases after February 1, 1975, are \npresumed to take the increase in tax liability into \naccount unless demonstrated otherwise by \nclear and convincing evidence.\nNatural gas from geopressured brine. \nQualified natural gas from geopressured brine \nis eligible for a percentage depletion rate of \n10%. This is natural gas that meets both of the \nfollowing conditions.\n\u2022Produced from a well you began to drill af-\nter September 1978 and before 1984.\n\u2022Determined in accordance with section \n503 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 \nto be produced from geopressured brine.\nMines and Geothermal \nDeposits\nCertain mines, oil and gas wells, and other nat-\nural deposits, including geothermal deposits, \nqualify for percentage depletion.\nMines, oil and gas wells, and other natural \ndeposits. The percentage of your gross in-\ncome from the property that you can deduct as \ndepletion depends on the type of deposit.\nSee section 613(b) for the percentage de-\npletion rates.Corporate deduction for iron ore and \ncoal. The percentage depletion deduction of a \ncorporation for iron ore and coal (including lig-\nnite) is reduced by 20% (0.20) of:\n\u2022The percentage depletion deduction for \nthe tax year (figured without this reduc-\ntion), minus\n\u2022The adjusted basis of the property at the \nclose of the tax year (figured without the \ndepletion deduction for the tax year).\nGross income from the property.  For prop-\nerty other than a geothermal deposit or an oil or \ngas well, gross income from the property \nmeans the gross income from mining. Mining \nincludes all of the following.\n\u2022Extracting ores or minerals from the \nground.\n\u2022Applying certain treatment processes  de-\nscribed below.\n\u2022Transporting ores or minerals (generally, \nnot more than 50 miles) from the point of \nextraction to the plants or mills in which the \ntreatment processes are applied.\nExcise tax.  Gross income from mining in-\ncludes the separately stated excise tax re-\nceived by a mine operator from the sale of coal \nto compensate the operator for the excise tax \nthe mine operator must pay to finance the bene-\nfits provided under the Black Lung Benefits \nRevenue Act of 1977.\nExtraction. Extracting ores or minerals \nfrom the ground includes extraction by mine \nowners or operators of ores or minerals from \nthe waste or residue of prior mining. This does \nnot apply to extraction from waste or residue of \nprior mining by the purchaser of the waste or \nresidue or the purchaser of the rights to extract \nores or minerals from the waste or residue.\nTreatment processes.  The processes in-\ncluded as mining depend on the ore or mineral \nmined. To qualify as mining, the treatment pro-\ncesses must be applied by the mine owner or \noperator. For a listing of treatment processes \nconsidered as mining, see section 613(c)(4) \nand the related regulations.\nTransportation of more than 50 miles.  If \nore or mineral must be transported more than \n50 miles to plants or mills to be treated because \nof physical and other requirements, the addi-\ntional authorized transportation may be consid-\nered mining and included in the calculation of \ngross income from mining if authorized by the \nIRS.\nIf you wish to include transportation of \nmore than 50 miles in the calculation of \ngross income from mining, request an \nadvance ruling from the IRS. Include in the re-\nquest the facts about the physical and other re-\nquirements that prevented the construction and \noperation of the plant (in which mining pro-\ncesses are applied) within 50 miles of the point \nof extraction. For more information about re-\nquesting an advance ruling, see Rev. Proc. \n2022- 1, available at IRS.gov/irb/2022-01_IRB , \nmodified by Rev.

You cannot take \na percentage depletion deduction for coal (in-\ncluding lignite) or iron ore mined in the United \nStates if both of the following apply.\n\u2022You disposed of it after holding it for more \nthan 1 year.\n\u2022You disposed of it under a contract under \nwhich you retain an economic interest in \nthe coal or iron ore.\nTreat any gain on the disposition as a capital \ngain.\nDisposal to related person.  This rule \ndoes not apply if you dispose of the coal or iron \nore to one of the following persons.\n\u2022A related person (as listed in chapter 2 of \nPub. 544).\n\u2022A person owned or controlled by the same \ninterests that own or control you.\nGeothermal deposits.  Geothermal deposits \nlocated in the United States or its possessions \nqualify for a percentage depletion rate of 15%. \nA geothermal deposit is a geothermal reservoir \nof natural heat stored in rocks or in a watery liq-\nuid or vapor (whether or not under pressure). \nFor percentage depletion purposes, a geother-\nmal deposit is not considered a gas well.\nFigure gross income from the property for a \ngeothermal steam well in the same way as for \noil and gas wells. See Gross income from the \nproperty , earlier, under Oil and Gas Wells . Per-\ncentage depletion on a geothermal deposit can-\nnot be more than 50% of your taxable income \nfrom the property.\nLessor's Gross Income\nIn the case of leased property, the depletion de-\nduction is divided between the lessor and the \nlessee.\nA lessor's gross income from the property \nthat qualifies for percentage depletion is usually \nthe total of the royalties received from the lease.\nBonuses and advanced royalties.  Bonuses \nand advanced royalties are payments a lessee \nmakes before production to a lessor for the \ngrant of rights in a lease or for minerals, gas, or \noil to be extracted from leased property. If you \nare the lessor, your income from bonuses and \nadvanced royalties received is subject to an al-\nlowance for depletion, as explained in the next \ntwo paragraphs.\nFiguring cost depletion.  To figure cost \ndepletion on a bonus, multiply your adjusted ba-\nsis in the property by a fraction, the numerator \nof which is the bonus and the denominator of \nwhich is the total bonus and royalties expected \nto be received. To figure cost depletion on ad-\nvanced royalties, use the calculation explained \nearlier under Cost Depletion , treating the num-\nber of units for which the advanced royalty is re-\nceived as the number of units sold.\nFiguring percentage depletion.  In the \ncase of mines, wells, and other natural deposits \nother than gas, oil, or geothermal property, you \nmay use the percentage rates discussed earlier \nunder Mines and Geothermal Deposits . Any bo-\nnus or advanced royalty payments are gener-\nally part of the gross income from the property \nto which the rates are applied in making the Page 40 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

However, for oil, gas, or geothermal \nproperty, gross income does not include lease \nbonuses, advanced royalties, or other amounts \npayable without regard to production from the \nproperty.\nEnding the lease.  If you receive a bonus \non a lease that ends or is abandoned before \nyou derive any income from mineral extraction \nor the cutting of timber, include in income the \ndepletion deduction you took on the bonus. Do \nthis for the year the lease ends or is aban-\ndoned. Also, increase your adjusted basis in the \nproperty to restore the depletion deduction you \npreviously subtracted.\nFor advanced royalties, include in income \nthe depletion claimed on minerals or timber for \nwhich the advanced royalties were paid, if the \nminerals were not produced or timber not cut \nbefore the lease ended. Include this amount in \nincome for the year the lease ends. Increase \nyour adjusted basis in the property by the \namount you include in income.\nDelay rentals.  These are payments for defer-\nring development of the property. Since delay \nrentals are ordinary rent, they are ordinary in-\ncome to the payee that is not subject to deple-\ntion. These rentals can be avoided by either \nabandoning the lease, beginning development \noperations, or obtaining production.\nTimber\nYou can figure timber depletion only by the cost \nmethod. Percentage depletion does not apply \nto timber. Base your depletion on your cost or \nother basis in the timber. Your cost does not in-\nclude the cost of land or any amounts recovera-\nble through depreciation.\nDepletion takes place when you cut stand-\ning timber. You can figure your depletion de-\nduction when the quantity of cut timber is first \naccurately measured in the process of exploita-\ntion.\nFiguring cost depletion.  To figure your cost \ndepletion allowance, you multiply the number of \ntimber units cut by your depletion unit.\nTimber units.  When you acquire timber \nproperty, you must make an estimate of the \nquantity of marketable timber reasonably \nknown, or on good evidence believed to exist \non the property. You measure the timber using \nfeet board measure (FBM), log scale, cords, or \nother units. If you later determine that you have \nmore or less units of timber, you must adjust the \noriginal estimate.\nThe term \u201ctimber property\u201d means your eco-\nnomic interest in standing timber in each tract or \nblock representing a separate timber account.\nDepletion unit.  You figure your depletion \nunit each year by taking the following steps.\n1.Determine your cost or adjusted basis of \nthe timber on hand at the beginning of the \nyear. Adjusted basis is defined under Cost \nDepletion  in the discussion on Mineral \nProperty , earlier.\n2.Add to the amount determined in (1) the \ncost of any timber units acquired during \nthe year and any additions to capital.3.Figure the number of timber units to take \ninto account by adding the number of tim-\nber units acquired during the year to the \nnumber of timber units on hand in the ac-\ncount at the beginning of the year and \nthen adding (or subtracting) any correction \nto the estimate of the number of timber \nunits remaining in the account.\n4.Divide the result of (2) by the result of (3). \nThis is your depletion unit.\nExample. You bought a timber tract for \n$160,000 and the land was worth as much as \nthe timber. Your basis for the timber is $80,000. \nBased on an estimated 1 million feet board \nmeasure (FBM) or 1,000 \u201cthousand board feet\u201d \n(MFBM) of standing timber, you figure your de-\npletion unit to be $80 per MFBM ($80,000 \u00f7 \n1,000). If you cut 500 MFBM of timber, your de-\npletion allowance would be $40,000 (500 \nMFBM \u00d7 $80).\nWhen to claim depletion.  Claim your deple-\ntion allowance as a deduction in the year of sale \nor other disposition of the products cut from the \ntimber, unless you choose to treat the cutting of \ntimber as a sale or exchange (explained below). \nInclude allowable depletion for timber products \nnot sold during the tax year the timber is cut as \na cost item in the closing inventory of timber \nproducts for the year. The inventory is your ba-\nsis for determining gain or loss in the tax year \nyou sell the timber products.\nExample. The facts are the same as in the \nprevious example, except that you sold only \nhalf of the timber products in the cutting year. \nYou would deduct $20,000 of the $40,000 de-\npletion that year. You would add the remaining \n$20,000 depletion to your closing inventory of \ntimber products.\nElecting to treat the cutting of timber as a \nsale or exchange.  You can elect, under cer-\ntain circumstances, to treat the cutting of timber \nheld for more than 1 year as a sale or ex-\nchange. You must make the election on your in-\ncome tax return for the tax year to which it ap-\nplies. The election can\u2019t be made on an \namended return. If you make this election, sub-\ntract the adjusted basis for depletion from the \nfair market value (FMV) of the timber on the first \nday of the tax year in which you cut it to figure \nthe gain or loss on the cutting. You generally re-\nport the gain as long -term capital gain. The \nFMV then becomes your basis for figuring your \nordinary gain or loss on the sale or other dispo-\nsition of the products cut from the timber. For \nmore information, see Timber  in chapter 2 of \nPub. 544.\nYou may revoke an election to treat the cut-\nting of timber as a sale or exchange, without the \nIRS's consent, by the due date (including exten-\nsions) for the return. The prior election (and rev-\nocation) is disregarded for purposes of making \na subsequent election. See Form T (Timber, \nForest Activities Schedule) for more informa-\ntion.\nForm T (Timber, Forest Activities Sched-\nule). Complete and attach Form T (Timber, \nForest Activities Schedule) to your income tax \nreturn if you claim a deduction for timber deple-\ntion, choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, or make an outright sale of \ntimber.\n10.\nBusiness Bad \nDebts\nIntroduction\nYou have a bad debt if you cannot collect \nmoney owed to you. A bad debt is either a busi-\nness bad debt or a nonbusiness bad debt. This \nchapter discusses only business bad debts.\nGenerally, a business bad debt is one that \ncomes from operating your trade or business. \nYou can deduct business bad debts on Sched-\nule C (Form 1040) or your applicable business \nincome tax return.\nAll other bad debts are nonbusiness bad \ndebts and are deductible only as short -term \ncapital losses.

        "content": "1120-X Amended U.S. Corporation \nIncome Tax Return\n1139 Corporation Application for \nTentative Refund\n3115 Application for Change in \nAccounting Method\nSee chapter 12  for information about getting \npublications and forms.\nDefinition of Business \nBad Debt\nA business bad debt is a loss from the worth-\nlessness of a debt that was either:\n\u2022Created or acquired in your trade or busi-\nness, or\n\u2022Closely related to your trade or business \nwhen it became partly or totally worthless.\nA debt is closely related to your trade or \nbusiness if your primary motive for incurring the \ndebt is business related. Bad debts of a corpo-\nration (other than an S corporation) are always \nbusiness bad debts.\nCredit sales.  Business bad debts are mainly \nthe result of credit sales to customers. Goods \nthat have been sold, but not yet paid for, and \nservices that have been performed, but not yet \npaid for, are recorded in your books as either \naccounts receivable or notes receivable. After a \nreasonable period of time, if you have tried to \ncollect the amount due, but are unable to do so, \nthe uncollectible part of the receivables be-\ncomes a business bad debt.\nAccounts or notes receivable valued at fair \nmarket value (FMV) when received are deducti-\nble only at that value, even though the FMV \nmay be less than the face value. If you pur-\nchased an account receivable for less than its \nface value, and the receivable subsequently be-\ncomes worthless, the most you\u2019re allowed to \ndeduct is the amount you paid to acquire it.\nYou can claim a business bad debt de-\nduction only if the amount owed to you \nwas previously included in gross in-\ncome. This applies to amounts owed to you \nfrom all sources of taxable income, including \nsales, services, rents, and interest.\nAccrual method.  If you use an accrual \nmethod of accounting, you generally report in-\ncome as you earn it. You can only claim a bad \ndebt deduction for an uncollectible receivable if \nyou have previously included the uncollectible \namount in income.\nIf you qualify, you can use the nonac-\ncrual- experience method of accounting, dis-\ncussed later. Under this method, you don\u2019t have \nto accrue income that, based on your experi-\nence, you don\u2019t expect to collect.\nCash method.  If you use the cash method \nof accounting, you generally report income \nwhen you receive payment. You can\u2019t claim a \nbad debt deduction for amounts owed to you \nbecause you never included those amounts in \nincome. For example, a cash basis architect \ncan\u2019t claim a bad debt deduction if a client fails \nto pay the bill because the architect's fee was \nnever included in income.  1120-X \n  1139 \n  3115 \nCAUTION!Debts from a former business.  If you sell \nyour business but retain its receivables, these \ndebts are business debts because they arose \nout of your trade or business. If any of these re-\nceivables subsequently become worthless, the \nloss is still a business bad debt.\nDebt acquired from a decedent.  The \ncharacter of a loss from debts of a business ac-\nquired from a decedent is determined in the \nsame way as debts acquired on the purchase of \na business. The executor of the decedent's es-\ntate treats any loss from the debts as a busi-\nness bad debt if the debts were closely related \nto the decedent's trade or business when they \nbecame worthless. Otherwise, a loss from \nthese debts becomes a nonbusiness bad debt \nfor the decedent's estate.\nLiquidation.  If you liquidate your business \nand some of the accounts receivable that you \nretain become worthless, they\u2019re treated as \nbusiness bad debts.\nTypes of Business Bad \nDebts\nBusiness bad debts may result from the follow-\ning.\nLoans to clients and suppliers.  If you loan \nmoney to a client, supplier, employee, or distrib-\nutor for a business reason and you\u2019re unable to \ncollect the loan after attempting to do so, you \nhave a business bad debt.\nDebts owed by political parties.  If a political \nparty (or other organization that accepts contri-\nbutions or spends money to influence elections) \nowes you money and the debt becomes worth-\nless, you can claim a bad debt deduction only if \nall of the following requirements are met.\n1.You use an accrual method of accounting.\n2.The debt arose from the sale of goods or \nservices in the ordinary course of your \ntrade or business.\n3.More than 30% of your receivables ac-\ncrued in the year of the sale were from \nsales to political parties.\n4.You made substantial and continuing ef-\nforts to collect on the debt.\nLoan or capital contribution.  You cannot \nclaim a bad debt deduction for a loan you made \nto a corporation if, based on the facts and cir-\ncumstances, the loan is actually a contribution \nto capital.\nDebts of an insolvent partner.  If your busi-\nness partnership breaks up and one of your for-\nmer partners becomes insolvent, you may have \nto pay more than your pro rata share of the part-\nnership's debts. If you pay any part of the insol-\nvent partner's share of the debts, you can claim \na bad debt deduction for the amount you paid \nthat is attributable to the insolvent partner's \nshare.\nBusiness loan guarantee.  If you guarantee a \ndebt that subsequently becomes worthless, the debt can qualify as a business bad debt if all of \nthe following requirements are met.\n\u2022You made the guarantee in the course of \nyour trade or business.\n\u2022You have a legal duty to pay the debt.\n\u2022You made the guarantee before the debt \nbecame worthless. You meet this require-\nment if you reasonably expected you \nwouldn\u2019t have to pay the debt without full \nreimbursement from the borrower.\n\u2022You received reasonable consideration for \nmaking the guarantee. You meet this re-\nquirement if you made the guarantee ac-\ncording to normal business practice or for \na good faith business purpose.\nExample.  Jane Zayne owns the Zayne \nDress Company. She guaranteed payment of a \n$20,000 note for Elegant Fashions, a dress out-\nlet. Elegant Fashions is one of Zayne's largest \nclients. Elegant Fashions later defaulted on the \nloan. As a result, Ms. Zayne paid the remaining \nbalance of the loan in full to the bank.\nShe can claim a business bad debt deduc-\ntion only for the amount she paid because her \nguarantee was made in the course of her trade \nor business for a good faith business purpose. \nShe was motivated by the desire to retain one \nof her better clients and keep a sales outlet.\nDeductible in the year paid.  If you make \na payment on a loan you guaranteed, you can \ndeduct it in the year paid, unless you have \nrights against the borrower.\nRights against a borrower.  When you \nmake payment on a loan you guaranteed, you \nmay have the right to take the place of the \nlender. The debt is then owed to you. If you \nhave this right, or some other right to demand \npayment from the borrower, you can\u2019t claim a \nbad debt deduction until these rights become \npartly or totally worthless.\nJoint debtor.  If two or more debtors jointly \nowe you money, your inability to collect from \none doesn\u2019t enable you to deduct a proportion-\nate amount as a bad debt.\nSale of mortgaged property.  If mortgaged or \npledged property is sold for less than the debt, \nthe unpaid, uncollectible balance of the debt is \na bad debt.\nWhen a Debt Becomes \nWorthless\nA debt becomes worthless when there is no \nlonger any chance the amount owed will be \npaid. This may occur on the date the debt is \ndue or prior to that date.\nTo demonstrate worthlessness, you must \nonly show that you have taken reasonable \nsteps to collect the debt but were unable to do \nso. It isn\u2019t necessary to go to court if you can \nshow that a judgment from the court would be \nuncollectible. Bankruptcy of your debtor is gen-\nerally good evidence of the worthlessness of at \nleast a part of an unsecured and unpreferred \ndebt.Page 42 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

It isn\u2019t a recovery of a \nbad debt. For information on the sale of an as-\nset, see Pub. 544.\nHow To Claim a \nBusiness Bad Debt\nThere are two methods to claim a business bad \ndebt.\n\u2022The specific charge-off method.\n\u2022The nonaccrual-experience method.\nGenerally, you must use the specific charge -off \nmethod. However, you may use the nonac-\ncrual- experience method if you meet the re-\nquirements discussed later under Nonac-\ncrual -Experience Method .\nSpecific Charge-off Method\nIf you use the specific charge -off method, you \ncan deduct specific business bad debts that be-\ncome either partly or totally worthless during the \ntax year. However, with respect to partly worth-\nless bad debts, your deduction is limited to the \namount you charged off on your books during \nthe year.\nPartly worthless debts.  You can deduct spe-\ncific bad debts that become partly uncollectible \nduring the tax year. Your tax deduction is limi-\nted to the amount you charge off on your books \nduring the year. You don\u2019t have to charge off \nand deduct your partly worthless debts annu-\nally. You can delay the charge -off until a later \nyear. However, you can\u2019t deduct any part of a \ndebt after the year it becomes totally worthless.\nSignificantly modified debt.  An excep-\ntion to the charge -off rule exists for debt that \nhas been significantly modified and on which \nthe holder recognized gain. For more informa-\ntion, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3).\nDeduction disallowed.  Generally, you \ncan claim a partial bad debt deduction only in \nthe year you make the charge -off on your \nbooks. If, under audit, the IRS doesn\u2019t allow \nyour deduction and the debt becomes partly \nworthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the \namount you charged off in that year plus the \ndisallowed amount charged off in the earlier \nyear. The charge -off in the earlier year, unless \nreversed on your books, fulfills the charge -off \nrequirement for the later year.\nTotally worthless debts.  If a debt becomes \ntotally worthless in the current tax year, you can \ndeduct the entire amount minus any amount de-\nducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was \nonly partly worthless.\nYou don\u2019t have to make an actual charge -off \non your books to claim a bad debt deduction for \na totally worthless debt. However, you may \nwant to do so. If you don\u2019t and the IRS later rules the debt is only partly worthless, you will \nnot be allowed a deduction for the debt in that \ntax year because a deduction of a partly worth-\nless bad debt is limited to the amount actually \ncharged off. See Partly worthless debts , earlier.\nFiling a claim for refund.  If you didn\u2019t deduct \na bad debt on your original return for the year it \nbecame worthless, you can file a claim for a \ncredit or refund. If the bad debt was totally \nworthless, you must file the claim by the later of \nthe following dates.\n\u20227 years from the date your original return \nwas due (not including extensions).\n\u20222 years from the date you paid the tax.\nIf the claim is for a partly worthless bad debt, \nyou must file the claim by the later of the follow-\ning dates.\n\u20223 years from the date you filed your original \nreturn.\n\u20222 years from the date you paid the tax.\nYou may have longer to file the claim if you \nwere unable to manage your financial affairs \ndue to a physical or mental impairment. Such \nan impairment requires proof of existence.\nFor details and more information about filing \na claim, see Pub. 556. Use one of the following \nforms to file a claim. For more information, see \nthe instructions for the applicable form.\nTable 10-1.

The amount \nyou include is limited to the amount you actually \ndeducted. However, you can exclude the amount deducted that did not reduce your tax. \nReport the recovery as \u201cOther income\u201d on the \nappropriate business form or schedule.\nSee Recoveries  in Pub. 525 for more infor-\nmation.\nNOL carryover.  If a bad debt deduction in-\ncreases an NOL carryover that has not expired \nbefore the beginning of the tax year in which the \nrecovery takes place, you treat the deduction as \nhaving reduced your tax. A bad debt deduction \nthat contributes to an NOL helps lower taxes in \nthe year to which you carry the NOL. For more \ninformation about NOLs for individuals, see \nPub. 536. Also, see the Instructions for Form \n1045, and the Instructions for Form 1139.\n11.\nOther Expenses\nWhat's New\nStandard mileage rate. For tax year 2022, the \nstandard mileage rate for the cost of operating \nyour car, van, pickup, or panel truck for busi-\nness use is:\n\u202258.5 cents per mile from January 1, 2022, \nthrough June 30, 2022; and\n\u202262.5 cents per mile from July 1, 2022, \nthrough December 31, 2022.\nFor more information, see Car and truck ex-\npenses  under Miscellaneous Expenses , later.\nReminders\nNo miscellaneous itemized deductions al-\nlowed. You can no longer claim any miscella-\nneous itemized deductions, including the de-\nduction for repayments (claim of right). \nMiscellaneous itemized deductions are those \ndeductions that would have been subject to the \n2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limitation.\nQualified business income deduction.  For \ntax years beginning after 2017, individual tax-\npayers and some trusts and estates may be en-\ntitled to a deduction of up to 20% of their quali-\nfied business income (QBI) from a trade or \nbusiness, including income from a pass-through \nentity, but not from a C corporation, plus 20% of \nqualified real estate investment trust (REIT) div-\nidends and qualified publicly traded partnership \n(PTP) income. The deduction is subject to mul-\ntiple limitations, such as the type of trade or \nbusiness, the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income, the \namount of W -2 wages paid in the trade or busi-\nness, and the unadjusted basis immediately af-\nter acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property held \nby the trade or business. The deduction can be \ntaken in addition to the standard or itemized de-\nductions.

If \nyou are self -employed and report your income \nand expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), see \nPub. 463.\nTo be deductible for tax purposes, expen-\nses incurred for travel and non -entertain-\nment- related meals must be ordinary and nec-\nessary expenses incurred while carrying on \nyour trade or business. For more information on \ntravel and non -entertainment- related meals, in-\ncluding deductibility, see Pub. 463.\nReimbursements\nA \u201creimbursement or allowance arrangement\u201d \nprovides for payment of advances, reimburse-\nments, and allowances for travel and non -enter-\ntainment- related meals expenses incurred by \nyour employees during the ordinary course of \nbusiness. If the expenses are substantiated, \nyou can deduct the allowable amount on your \ntax return. Because of differences between ac-\ncounting methods and tax law, the amount you \ncan deduct for tax purposes may not be the \nsame as the amount you deduct on your busi-\nness books and records. For example, you can \ndeduct 100% of the cost of meals on your busi-\nness books and records. However, only 50% of \nthese costs are allowed by law as a tax deduc-\ntion.\nHow you deduct a business expense under \na reimbursement or allowance arrangement de-\npends on whether you have:\n\u2022An accountable plan, or\n\u2022A nonaccountable plan.\nIf you reimburse these expenses under an ac-\ncountable plan, deduct them as travel and \nnon-entertainment-related meals expenses.\nIf you reimburse these expenses under a \nnonaccountable plan, report the reimburse-\nments as wages on Form W -2, and deduct \nthem as wages on the appropriate line of your \ntax return. If you make a single payment to your \nemployees and it includes both wages and an \nexpense reimbursement, you must specify the \namount of the reimbursement and report it ac-\ncordingly. See Table 11 -1.  8995 \n  8995-A \n  W-2 Accountable Plans\nAn accountable plan requires your employees \nto meet all of the following requirements. Each \nemployee must:\n1.Have paid or incurred deductible expen-\nses while performing services as your em-\nployee,\n2.Adequately account to you for these ex-\npenses within a reasonable period of time, \nand\n3.Return any excess reimbursement or al-\nlowance within a reasonable period of \ntime.\nAn arrangement under which you advance \nmoney to employees is treated as meeting (3) \nabove only if the following requirements are \nalso met.\n\u2022The advance is reasonably calculated not \nto exceed the amount of anticipated ex-\npenses.\n\u2022You make the advance within a reasonable \nperiod of time of your employee paying or \nincurring the expense.\nIf any expenses reimbursed under this ar-\nrangement aren\u2019t substantiated, or an excess \nreimbursement isn\u2019t returned within a reasona-\nble period of time by an employee, you can\u2019t \ntreat these expenses as reimbursed under an \naccountable plan. Instead, treat the reimbursed \nexpenses as paid under a nonaccountable \nplan, discussed later.\nAdequate accounting.  Your employees must \nadequately account to you for their travel and \nnon-entertainment- related meals expenses. \nThey must give you documentary evidence of \ntheir travel, mileage, and other employee busi-\nness expenses. This evidence should include \nitems such as receipts, along with either a \nstatement of expenses, an account book, a day \nplanner, or similar record in which the employee \nentered each expense at or near the time the \nexpense was incurred.\nExcess reimbursement or allowance.  An \nexcess reimbursement or allowance is any \namount you pay to an employee that is more \nthan the business -related expenses for which \nthe employee adequately accounted. The em-\nployee must return any excess reimbursement \nor other expense allowance to you within a rea-\nsonable period of time.\nReasonable period of time.  A reasonable \nperiod of time depends on the facts and circum-\nstances. Generally, actions that take place \nwithin the times specified in the following list will \nbe treated as taking place within a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n1.You give an advance within 30 days of the \ntime the employee pays or incurs the ex-\npense.\n2.Your employees adequately account for \ntheir expenses within 60 days after the ex-\npenses were paid or incurred.\n3.Your employees return any excess reim-\nbursement within 120 days after the ex-\npenses were paid or incurred.Page 44 of 57  Fileid: \u2026 tions/p535/2022/a/xml/cycle01/source 16:31 - 2-Feb-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

You can claim a deduction for \ntravel and non -entertainment- related meals ex-\npenses if you reimburse your employees for \nthese expenses under an accountable plan. \nGenerally, the amount you can deduct for \nnon-entertainment- related meals is subject to a \n50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole pro-\nprietor, or are filing as a single member limited \nliability company, deduct the travel reimburse-\nment on line 24a and the deductible part of the \nnon-entertainment- related meals reimburse-\nment on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040).\nIf you are filing an income tax return for a \ncorporation, include the reimbursement on the \nOther deductions  line of Form 1120. If you are \nfiling any other business income tax return, \nsuch as a partnership or S corporation return, \ndeduct the reimbursement on the appropriate \nline of the return as provided in the instructions \nfor that return.\nPer Diem and Car Allowances\nYou can reimburse your employees under an \naccountable plan based on travel days, miles, \nor some other fixed allowance. In these cases, \nyour employee is considered to have accounted \nto you for the amount of the expense that \ndoesn\u2019t exceed the rates established by the \nfederal government. Your employee must ac-\ntually substantiate to you the other elements of \nthe expense, such as time, place, and business \npurpose.\nFederal rate.  The federal rate can be figured \nusing any one of the following methods.\n1.For car expenses:\na.The standard mileage rate.\nb.A fixed and variable rate (FAVR).\n2.For per diem amounts:\na.The regular federal per diem rate.\nb.The standard meal allowance.\nc.The high-low rate.\nCar allowance.  Your employee is considered \nto have accounted to you for car expenses that \ndon\u2019t exceed the standard mileage rate. For tax \nyear 2022, the standard business mileage rate \nis:\n\u202258.5 cents per mile for January 1, 2022, \nthrough June 30, 2022; and\n\u202262.5 cents per mile for July 1, 2022, \nthrough December 31, 2022.\nTo find the standard mileage rate for 2023, \ngo to IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-\nMileage-Rates .\nYou can choose to reimburse your employ-\nees using an FAVR allowance. This is an allow-\nance that includes a combination of payments \ncovering fixed and variable costs, such as a \ncents-per- mile rate to cover your employees' \nvariable operating costs (such as gas, oil, etc.) \nplus a flat amount to cover your employees' fixed costs (such as depreciation, insurance, \netc.). For information on using an FAVR allow-\nance, see Revenue Procedure 2019 -46, availa-\nble at IRS.gov/irb/2019-49_IRB#RP-2019-46 , \nand Notice 2022 -03, available at IRS.gov/irb/\n2022-02_IRB .\nPer diem allowance.  If your employee ac-\ntually substantiates to you the other elements \n(discussed earlier) of the expenses reimbursed \nusing the per diem allowance, how you report \nand deduct the allowance depends on whether \nthe allowance is for lodging and meal expenses \nor for meal expenses only and whether the al-\nlowance is more than the federal rate.\nRegular federal per diem rate.  The regu-\nlar federal per diem rate is the highest amount \nthe federal government will pay to its employ-\nees while away from home on travel. It has the \nfollowing two components.\n1.Lodging expense.\n2.Meal and incidental expenses (M&IE).\nThe rates are different for different locations. \nSee GSA.gov/perdiem  for the per diem rates in \nthe continental United States.\nStandard meal allowance.  The federal \nrate for M&IE is the standard meal allowance. \nYou can pay only an M&IE allowance to em-\nployees who travel away from home if:\n\u2022You pay the employee for actual expenses \nfor lodging based on receipts submitted to \nyou,\n\u2022You provide for the lodging,\n\u2022You pay for the actual expense of the lodg-\ning directly to the provider,\n\u2022You don\u2019t have a reasonable belief that \nlodging expenses were incurred by the \nemployee, or\n\u2022The allowance is figured on a basis similar \nto that used in figuring the employee's wa-\nges (that is, number of hours worked or \nmiles traveled).\nPer diem rates online.  You can access \nper diem rates at GSA.gov/perdiem .High- low method.  This is a simplified \nmethod of figuring the federal per diem rate for \ntravel within the continental United States. It \neliminates the need to keep a current list of the \nper diem rate for each city.\nUnder the high -low method, the per diem \namount for travel during January through Sep-\ntember of 2022 is $296 ($74 for M&IE) for cer-\ntain high -cost locations. All other areas have a \nper diem amount of $202 ($64 for M&IE). The \nhigh- cost localities eligible for the higher per \ndiem amount under the high -low method are lis-\nted in Notice 2021 -52, available at IRS.gov/irb/\n2021-38_IRB#NOT-2021-52 .\nEffective October 1, 2023, the per diem rate \nfor high -cost locations will increase to $297 \n($74 for M&IE). The rate for all other locations \nwill increase to $204 ($64 for M&IE). For Octo-\nber, November, and December 2023, you can \neither continue to use the rates described in the \npreceding paragraph or change to the new \nrates. However, you must use the same rate for \nall employees reimbursed under the high -low \nmethod.\nFor more information about the high -low \nmethod, see Notice 2022 -44, available at \nIRS.gov/irb/2022-41_IRB#NOT-2022-44 . See \nGSA.gov/perdiem  for the current per diem rates \nfor all locations.\nReporting per diem and car allowances. \nThe following discussion explains how to report \nper diem and car allowances. The manner in \nwhich you report them depends on how the al-\nlowance compares to the federal rate. See Ta-\nble 11 -1.\nAllowance less than or equal to the fed-\neral rate.  If your allowance for the employee is \nless than or equal to the appropriate federal \nrate, that allowance isn\u2019t included as part of the \nemployee's pay in box 1 of the employee's \nForm W -2.

Deduct it as travel expenses (ex-\nplained above). This part of the allowance is \ntreated as reimbursed under an accountable \nplan.\nInclude the amount that is more than the \nfederal rate in box 1 (and in boxes 3 and 5 if \nthey apply) of the employee's Form W -2. De-\nduct it as wages subject to income tax withhold-\ning, social security, Medicare, and federal un-\nemployment taxes. This part of the allowance is \ntreated as reimbursed under a nonaccountable \nplan (explained later) under Nonaccountable \nPlans .\nMeals\nUnder an accountable plan, you can generally \ndeduct only 50% of any otherwise deductible \nbusiness- related meal expenses you reimburse \nyour employees. The deduction limit applies \neven if you reimburse them for 100% of the ex-\npenses.\nApplication of the 50% limit.  The 50% de-\nduction limit applies to reimbursements you \nmake to your employees for expenses they in-\ncur for meals while traveling away from home \non business and meals for business customers \nat your place of business, a restaurant, or an-\nother location. It applies to expenses incurred at \na business convention or reception, business \nmeeting, or business luncheon at a club. The \ndeduction limit may also apply to meals you fur-\nnish on your premises to your employees.\nSection 210 of the Taxpayer Certainty \nand Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 \nprovides for the temporary allowance \nof a 100% business meal deduction for food or \nbeverages provided by a restaurant and paid or \nincurred after December 31, 2020, and before \nJanuary 1, 2023.\nRelated expenses.  Taxes and tips relat-\ning to a meal you reimburse to your employee \nunder an accountable plan are included in the \namount subject to the 50% limit.

If \nthe per diem allowance you provide is less than \nthe federal per diem rate for the area of travel, \nyou can treat 40% of the per diem allowance as \nthe amount for food and beverages.\nTIPMeal expenses when subject to \u201chours of \nservice\u201d limits.  You can deduct 80% of the \ncost of reimbursed meals your employees con-\nsume while away from their tax home on busi-\nness during, or incident to, any period subject to \nthe Department of Transportation's \u201chours of \nservice\u201d limits.\nSee Pub. 463 for a detailed discussion of in-\ndividuals subject to the Department of Trans-\nportation's \u201chours of service\u201d limits.\nDe minimis (minimal) fringe benefit.  P.L. \n115- 97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, changed the \nrules for the deduction of food or beverage ex-\npenses that are excludable from employee in-\ncome as a de minimis fringe benefit. For \namounts incurred or paid after 2017, the 50% \nlimit on deductions for food or beverage expen-\nses also applies to food or beverage expenses \nexcludable from employee income as a de mini-\nmis fringe benefit. While your business deduc-\ntion may be limited, the rules that allow you to \nexclude certain de minimis meals and meals on \nyour business premises from your employee's \nwages still apply. See Meals  in section 2 of \nPub. 15-B.\nCompany cafeteria or executive dining \nroom.  The cost of food and beverages you \nprovide primarily to your employees on your \nbusiness premises is deductible. This includes \nthe cost of maintaining the facilities for provid-\ning the food and beverages. These expenses \nare subject to the 50% limit unless they are \ncompensation to your employees (explained \nlater).\nEmployee activities.  The expense of provid-\ning recreational, social, or similar activities (in-\ncluding the use of a facility) for your employees \nis deductible and isn\u2019t subject to the 50% limit. \nThe benefit must be primarily for your employ-\nees who aren\u2019t highly compensated.\nFor this purpose, a highly compensated em-\nployee is an employee who meets either of the \nfollowing requirements.\n1.Owned a 5%-or-more interest in the busi-\nness during the year or the preceding \nyear. An employee is treated as owning \nany interest owned by their sibling, \nspouse, ancestors, and lineal descend-\nants.\n2.Received more than $130,000 in pay for \nthe preceding year. You can choose to in-\nclude only employees who were also in \nthe top 20% of employees when ranked by \npay for the preceding year.\nFor example, the expenses for food, bever-\nages, and entertainment for a company -wide \npicnic aren\u2019t subject to the 50% or 100% limit.\nMeals or entertainment treated as compen-\nsation.  The 50% limit doesn\u2019t apply to either of \nthe following.\n1.Expenses for meals or entertainment that \nyou treat as:\na.Compensation to an employee who \nwas the recipient of the meals or en-\ntertainment, and\nb.Wages subject to withholding of fed-\neral income tax.2.Expenses for meals or entertainment if:\na.A recipient of the meals or entertain-\nment who isn\u2019t your employee has to \ninclude the expenses in gross income \nas compensation for services or as a \nprize or award; and\nb.You include that amount on a Form \n1099-MISC issued to the recipient, if a \nForm 1099-MISC is required.\nSales of meals or entertainment.  You can \ndeduct the cost of meals or entertainment (in-\ncluding the use of facilities) you sell to the pub-\nlic. For example, if you run a nightclub, your ex-\npense for the entertainment you furnish to your \ncustomers, such as a floor show, is a business \nexpense that is fully deductible. The 100% limit \ndoesn\u2019t apply to this expense.\nProviding meals or entertainment to gen-\neral public to promote goodwill.  You can \ndeduct the cost of providing meals, entertain-\nment, or recreational facilities to the general \npublic as a means of advertising or promoting \ngoodwill in the community. The 50% or 100% \nlimit doesn\u2019t apply to this expense.\nDirector, stockholder, or employee meet-\nings.  You can deduct entertainment expenses \ndirectly related to business meetings of your \nemployees, partners, stockholders, agents, or \ndirectors. You can provide some minor social \nactivities, but the main purpose of the meeting \nmust be your company's business. These ex-\npenses are subject to the 100% limit.\nTrade association meetings.  You can de-\nduct expenses directly related to, and neces-\nsary for, attending business meetings or con-\nventions of certain tax -exempt organizations. \nThese organizations include business leagues, \nchambers of commerce, real estate boards, \nand trade and professional associations.\nNonaccountable Plans\nA nonaccountable plan is an arrangement that \ndoesn\u2019t meet the requirements for an accounta-\nble plan. All amounts paid, or treated as paid, \nunder a nonaccountable plan are reported as \nwages on Form W -2. The payments are subject \nto income tax withholding, social security, Medi-\ncare, and federal unemployment taxes. You can \ndeduct the reimbursement as compensation or \nwages only to the extent it meets the deductibil-\nity tests for employees' pay in chapter 2 . Deduct \nthe allowable amount as compensation or wa-\nges on the appropriate line of your income tax \nreturn, as provided in its instructions.\nMiscellaneous Expenses\nIn addition to travel, meal, and certain entertain-\nment expenses, there are other expenses you \ncan deduct.\nAdvertising expenses.  You can generally de-\nduct reasonable advertising expenses that are \ndirectly related to your business activities. Gen-\nerally, you can\u2019t deduct amounts paid to influ-\nence legislation (for example, lobbying).

For example, the cost of ad-\nvertising that encourages people to contribute \nto the Red Cross, to buy U.S. savings bonds, or \nto participate in similar causes is usually deduc-\ntible.\nAnticipated liabilities. Anticipated liabilities or \nreserves for anticipated liabilities aren\u2019t deducti-\nble. For example, assume you sold 1 -year TV \nservice contracts this year totaling $50,000. \nFrom experience, you know you will have ex-\npenses of about $15,000 in the coming year for \nthese contracts. You can\u2019t deduct any of the \n$15,000 this year by charging expenses to a re-\nserve or liability account. You can deduct your \nexpenses only when you actually pay or accrue \nthem, depending on your accounting method.\nBribes and kickbacks.  Engaging in the pay-\nment of bribes or kickbacks is a serious criminal \nmatter. Such activity could result in criminal \nprosecution. Any payments that appear to have \nbeen made, either directly or indirectly, to an of-\nficial or employee of any government or an \nagency or instrumentality of any government \naren\u2019t deductible for tax purposes and are in vi-\nolation of the law.\nPayments paid directly or indirectly to a per-\nson in violation of any federal or state law (but \nonly if that state law is generally enforced, de-\nfined below) that provides for a criminal penalty \nor for the loss of a license or privilege to engage \nin a trade or business aren\u2019t allowed as a de-\nduction for tax purposes.\nMeaning of \u201cgenerally enforced.\u201d  A state \nlaw is considered generally enforced unless it is \nnever enforced or enforced only for infamous \npersons or persons whose violations are extra-\nordinarily flagrant. For example, a state law is \ngenerally enforced unless proper reporting of a \nviolation of the law results in enforcement only \nunder unusual circumstances.\nKickbacks.  A kickback is a payment for re-\nferring a client, patient, or customer. The com-\nmon kickback situation occurs when money or \nproperty is given to someone as payment for in-\nfluencing a third party to purchase from, use the \nservices of, or otherwise deal with the person \nwho pays the kickback. In many cases, the per-\nson whose business is being sought or enjoyed \nby the person who pays the kickback isn\u2019t \naware of the payment.\nFor example, the Yard Corporation is in the \nbusiness of repairing ships. It returns 10% of \nthe repair bills as kickbacks to the captains and \nchief officers of the vessels it repairs. Although \nthis practice is considered an ordinary and nec-\nessary expense of getting business, it is clearly \na violation of a state law that is generally en-\nforced. These expenditures aren\u2019t deductible \nfor tax purposes, whether or not the owners of \nthe shipyard are subsequently prosecuted.\nForm 1099 -MISC.

Sole proprietors, partners in a part-\nnership, or shareholders in an S corporation \nmay be able to deduct charitable contributions \nmade by their businesses on Schedule A (Form \n1040).\nExample.  You paid $15 to a local church \nfor a half- page ad in a program for a concert it is \nsponsoring. The purpose of the ad was to en-\ncourage readers to buy your products. Your \npayment isn\u2019t a charitable contribution. You can \ndeduct it as an advertising expense.\nExample.  You made a $100,000 donation \nto a committee organized by the local Chamber \nof Commerce to bring a convention to your city, \nintended to increase business activity, including \nyours.

Credit card \ncompanies charge a fee to businesses who ac-\ncept their cards. This fee when paid or incurred \nby the business can be deducted as a business \nexpense.Damages recovered.  Special rules apply to \ncompensation you receive for damages sus-\ntained as a result of patent infringement, breach \nof contract or fiduciary duty, or antitrust viola-\ntions. You must include this compensation in \nyour income. However, you may be able to take \na special deduction. The deduction applies only \nto amounts recovered for actual economic in-\njury, not any additional amount. The deduction \nis the smaller of the following.\n\u2022The amount you received or accrued for \ndamages in the tax year reduced by the \namount you paid or incurred in the year to \nrecover that amount.\n\u2022Your losses from the injury you haven\u2019t de-\nducted.\nDemolition expenses or losses.

You must be able \nto show the education maintains or improves \nskills required in your trade or business, or that \nit is required by law or regulations, for keeping \nyour license to practice, status, or job. For ex-\nample, an attorney can deduct the cost of at-\ntending Continuing Legal Education (CLE) \nclasses that are required by the state bar asso-\nciation to maintain their license to practice law.\nEducation expenses you incur to meet the \nminimum requirements of your present trade or \nbusiness, or those that qualify you for a new \ntrade or business, aren\u2019t deductible.

        "content": "Impairment- related expenses.  If you are dis-\nabled, you can deduct expenses necessary for \nyou to be able to work (impairment -related ex-\npenses) as a business expense, rather than as \na medical expense.\nYou are disabled if you have either of the fol-\nlowing.\n\u2022A physical or mental disability (for exam-\nple, blindness or deafness) that function-\nally limits your being employed.\n\u2022A physical or mental impairment that sub-\nstantially limits one or more of your major \nlife activities.\nThe expense qualifies as a business ex-\npense if all the following apply.\n\u2022Your work clearly requires the expense for \nyou to satisfactorily perform that work.\n\u2022The goods or services purchased are \nclearly not needed or used, other than inci-\ndentally, in your personal activities.\n\u2022Their treatment isn\u2019t specifically provided \nfor under other tax law provisions.\nExample.  You are blind. You must use a \nreader to do your work, both at and away from \nyour place of work. The reader's services are \nonly for your work. You can deduct your expen-\nses for the reader as a business expense.\nInternet- related expenses.

For more information about amor-\ntizing startup and organizational costs, see \nchapter 8 .\nInterview expense allowances.  Reimburse-\nments you make to job candidates for transpor-\ntation or other expenses related to interviews \nfor possible employment aren\u2019t wages. You can \ndeduct the reimbursements as a business ex-\npense. However, expenses for food and bever-\nages are subject to the 50% limit discussed ear-\nlier under Meals .\nLegal and professional fees.  Fees charged \nby accountants and attorneys that are ordinary \nand necessary expenses directly related to op-\nerating your business are deductible as busi-\nness expenses. However, legal fees you pay to \nacquire business assets usually aren\u2019t deducti-\nble. These costs are added to the basis of the \nproperty.\nFees that include payments for work of a \npersonal nature (such as drafting a will or dam-\nages arising from a personal injury) aren\u2019t al-\nlowed as a business deduction on Schedule C \n(Form 1040). If the invoice includes both busi-\nness and personal charges, figure the business \nportion as follows: multiply the total amount of \nthe bill by a fraction, the numerator of which is \nthe amount attributable to business matters, \nand the denominator of which is the total \namount paid. The result is the portion of the in-\nvoice attributable to business expenses. The \nportion attributable to personal matters is the \ndifference between the total amount and the \nbusiness portion (figured above).\nLegal fees related to doing or keeping your \njob, such as those you paid to defend yourself \nagainst criminal charges arising out of your trade or business, may be deductible on Sched-\nule A (Form 1040) if you itemize deductions. \nFor more information, see Pub. 529.\nCertain payments made in sexual har-\nassment or sexual abuse cases.  For \namounts paid or incurred after December 22, \n2017, new section 162(q) provides that no de-\nduction is allowed under section 162 for any \nsettlement or payment related to sexual harass-\nment or sexual abuse if it is subject to a nondi-\nsclosure agreement. In addition, attorney\u2019s fees \nrelated to such a settlement or payment aren\u2019t \nallowed as a deduction.\nTax preparation fees.  The cost of hiring a \ntax professional, such as a certified public ac-\ncountant (CPA), to prepare that part of your tax \nreturn relating to your business as a sole pro-\nprietor is deductible on Schedule C (Form \n1040). You can deduct the expenses of prepar-\ning tax schedules relating to rental properties \non Schedule E or farm income and expenses \non Schedule F. Expenses for completing the re-\nmainder of the return are miscellaneous deduc-\ntions and are no longer deductible.\nYou can also claim a business deduction for \namounts paid or incurred in resolving asserted \ntax deficiencies for your business operated as a \nsole proprietor.\nLicenses and regulatory fees.  Licenses and \nregulatory fees for your trade or business paid \nannually to state or local governments are gen-\nerally deductible. Some licenses and fees may \nhave to be amortized. See chapter 8  for more \ninformation.\nLobbying expenses.  Generally, lobbying ex-\npenses aren\u2019t deductible. Lobbying expenses \ninclude amounts paid or incurred for any of the \nfollowing activities.\n\u2022Influencing legislation.\n\u2022Participating in or intervening in any politi-\ncal campaign for, or against, any candidate \nfor public office.\n\u2022Attempting to influence the general public, \nor segments of the public, about elections, \nlegislative matters, or referendums.\n\u2022Communicating directly with covered ex-\necutive branch officials (defined later) in \nany attempt to influence the official actions \nor positions of those officials.\n\u2022Researching, preparing, planning, or coor-\ndinating any of the preceding activities.\nYour expenses for influencing legislation \nand communicating directly with a covered ex-\necutive branch official include a portion of your \nlabor costs and general and administrative \ncosts of your business. For information on mak-\ning this allocation, see section 1. 162- 28 of the \nregulations.\nYou can\u2019t claim a charitable or business ex-\npense deduction for amounts paid to an organi-\nzation if both of the following apply.\n\u2022The organization conducts lobbying activi-\nties on matters of direct financial interest to \nyour business.\n\u2022A principal purpose of your contribution is \nto avoid the rules discussed earlier that \nprohibit a business deduction for lobbying \nexpenses.\nIf a tax -exempt organization, other than a \nsection 501(c)(3) organization, provides you with a notice on the part of dues that is allocable \nto nondeductible lobbying and political expen-\nses, you can\u2019t deduct that part of the dues.\nCovered executive branch official.  For \npurposes of this discussion, a \u201ccovered execu-\ntive branch official\u201d is any of the following.\n1.The President.\n2.The Vice President.\n3.Any officer or employee of the White \nHouse Office of the Executive Office of the \nPresident and the two most senior level of-\nficers of each of the other agencies in the \nExecutive Office.\n4.Any individual who:\na.Is serving in a position in Level I of the \nExecutive Schedule under section \n5312 of title 5, United States Code;\nb.Has been designated by the Presi-\ndent as having Cabinet-level status; \nor\nc.Is an immediate deputy of an individ-\nual listed in item (a) or (b).\nExceptions to denial of deduction.  The \ngeneral denial of the deduction doesn\u2019t apply to \nthe following.\n\u2022Any in-house expenses for influencing leg-\nislation and communicating directly with a \ncovered executive branch official if those \nexpenses for the tax year don\u2019t exceed \n$2,000 (excluding overhead expenses).\n\u2022Expenses incurred by taxpayers engaged \nin the trade or business of lobbying (pro-\nfessional lobbyists) on behalf of another \nperson (but does apply to payments by the \nother person to the lobbyist for lobbying \nactivities).\nMoving machinery.  Generally, the cost of \nmoving machinery from one city to another is a \ndeductible expense. So is the cost of moving \nmachinery from one plant to another, or from \none part of your plant to another. You can de-\nduct the cost of installing the machinery in the \nnew location. However, you must capitalize the \ncosts of installing or moving newly purchased \nmachinery.\nOutplacement services.  The costs of out-\nplacement services you provide to your employ-\nees to help them find new employment, such as \ncareer counseling, resume assistance, skills as-\nsessment, etc., are deductible.\nThe costs of outplacement services may \ncover more than one deduction category. For \nexample, deduct as a utilities expense the cost \nof telephone calls made under this service and \ndeduct as a rental expense the cost of renting \nmachinery and equipment for this service.\nFor information on whether the value of out-\nplacement services is includible in your employ-\nees' income, see Pub. 15-B.\nPenalties and fines.  Penalties paid for late \nperformance or nonperformance of a contract \nare generally deductible. For instance, you own \nand operate a construction company.

Contributions or gifts \npaid to political parties or candidates aren\u2019t de-\nductible. In addition, expenses paid or incurred \nto take part in any political campaign of a candi-\ndate for public office aren\u2019t deductible.\nIndirect political contributions.  You \ncan\u2019t deduct indirect political contributions and costs of taking part in political activities as busi-\nness expenses. Examples of nondeductible ex-\npenses include the following.\n\u2022Advertising in a convention program of a \npolitical party, or in any other publication if \nany of the proceeds from the publication \nare for, or intended for, the use of a politi-\ncal party or candidate.\n\u2022Admission to a dinner or program (includ-\ning, but not limited to, galas, dances, film \npresentations, parties, and sporting \nevents) if any of the proceeds from the \nfunction are for, or intended for, the use of \na political party or candidate.\n\u2022Admission to an inaugural ball, gala, pa-\nrade, concert, or similar event if identified \nwith a political party or candidate.\nRepairs. The cost of repairing or improving \nproperty used in your trade or business is either \na deductible or capital expense. Routine main-\ntenance that keeps your property in a normal ef-\nficient operating condition, but that doesn\u2019t ma-\nterially increase the value or substantially \nprolong the useful life of the property, is deduc-\ntible in the year that it is incurred. Otherwise, \nthe cost must be capitalized and depreciated. \nSee Form 4562 and its instructions for how to \nfigure and claim the depreciation deduction.\nThe cost of repairs includes the costs of la-\nbor, supplies, and certain other items. The \nvalue of your own labor isn\u2019t deductible. Exam-\nples of repairs include:\n\u2022Reconditioning floors (but not replace-\nment),\n\u2022Repainting the interior and exterior walls of \na building,\n\u2022Cleaning and repairing roofs and gutters, \nand\n\u2022Fixing plumbing leaks (but not replacement \nof fixtures).\nRepayments. If you had to repay an amount \nyou included in your income in an earlier year, \nyou may be able to deduct the amount repaid \nfor the year in which you repaid it. Or, if the \namount you repaid is more than $3,000, you \nmay be able to take a credit against your tax for \nthe year in which you repaid it. In most cases, \nyou can claim a deduction or credit only if the \nrepayment qualifies as an expense or loss in-\ncurred in your trade or business or in a for -profit \ntransaction.\nType of deduction.  The type of deduction \nyou are allowed in the year of repayment de-\npends on the type of income you included in the \nearlier year. For instance, if you repay an \namount you previously reported as a capital \ngain, deduct the repayment as a capital loss as \nexplained in the Instructions for Schedule D \n(Form 1040). If you reported it as self -employ-\nment income, deduct it as a business expense \non Schedule C (Form 1040), or a farm expense \non Schedule F (Form 1040).\nIf you reported the amount as wages, unem-\nployment compensation, or other nonbusiness \nordinary income, you may be able to deduct it \nas an other itemized deduction if the amount re-\npaid is over $3,000.Beginning in 2018, due to the suspen-\nsion of miscellaneous itemized deduc-\ntions subject to the 2% floor under sec-\ntion 67(a), you aren\u2019t able to deduct the \nrepayment as an itemized deduction if it is \n$3,000 or less.\nRepayment\u2014 $3,000 or less.  If the \namount you repaid was $3,000 or less, deduct it \nfrom your income in the year you repaid it.\nRepayment\u2014 Over $3,000.  If the amount \nyou repaid was more than $3,000, you can de-\nduct the repayment as an other itemized deduc-\ntion on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you \nincluded the income under a \u201cclaim of right.\u201d \nThis means that at the time you included the in-\ncome, it appeared that you had an unrestricted \nright to it. However, you can choose to take a \ncredit for the year of repayment. Figure your tax \nunder both methods and use the method that \nresults in less tax.\nMethod 1.  Figure your tax for 2022 claim-\ning a deduction for the repaid amount.\nMethod 2.  Figure your tax for 2022 claim-\ning a credit for the repaid amount. Follow these \nsteps.\n1.Figure your tax for 2022 without deducting \nthe repaid amount.\n2.Refigure your tax from the earlier year \nwithout including in income the amount \nyou repaid in 2022.\n3.Subtract the tax in (2) from the tax shown \non your return for the earlier year. This is \nthe amount of your credit.\n4.Subtract the answer in (3) from the tax for \n2022 figured without the deduction (step \n1).\nIf Method 1 results in less tax, deduct the \namount repaid as discussed earlier under Type \nof deduction.\nIf Method 2 results in less tax, claim the \ncredit on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13z, and \nwrite \u201cI.R.C. 1341\u201d next to line 13z.\nExample.  For 2021, you filed a return and \nreported your income on the cash method. In \n2022, you repaid $5,000 included in your 2021 \ngross income under a claim of right. Your filing \nstatus in 2022 and 2021 is single.

        "content": "The following points will assist you when se-\nlecting a tax return preparer.\n\u2022Check the preparer\u2019s qualifications.  All \npaid tax return preparers are required to \nhave a PTIN.\n\u2022Check the preparer\u2019s history.  You can \ncheck with the Better Business Bureau to \nfind out if a preparer has a questionable \nhistory. Check for disciplinary actions and \nthe license status for credentialed prepar-\ners. For CPAs, check with the State Board \nof Accountancy. For attorneys, check with \nthe State Bar Association. For Enrolled \nAgents (EAs), go to IRS.gov/Tax-\nProfessionals/Verify-the-Status-of-an-\nEnrolled-Agent  and follow the instructions \nfor requesting EA status verification.\n\u2022Ask about service fees.  Avoid preparers \nwho base their fee on a percentage of your \nrefund or those who say they can get \nlarger refunds than others can. Always \nmake sure any refund due is sent directly \nto you or deposited into your bank ac-\ncount. You should not have your refund \ndeposited into a preparer\u2019s bank account.\n\u2022Ask to e-file  your return.  Make sure your \npreparer offers IRS e-file . Any paid pre-\nparer who prepares and files more than 10 \nreturns must generally e-file  their clients\u2019 \nreturns. The IRS has safely processed \nmore than 1.3 billion e-filed  tax returns.\n\u2022Make sure the preparer is available. \nYou need to ensure that you can contact \nthe tax preparer after you file your return. \nThat\u2019s true even after the April 17, 2023, \ndue date for individual returns. The due \ndate for partnerships and S corporations \nusing a calendar year is March 15, 2023. \nYou may need to contact the preparer if \nquestions come up about your tax return at \na later time.\n\u2022Provide tax records.  A good preparer will \nask to see your records and receipts. They \nask you questions to report your total in-\ncome and the tax benefits you\u2019re entitled to \nclaim. These may include tax deductions, \ntax credits, and other items. Do not use a \npreparer who is willing to e-file  your return \nusing your last pay stub instead of your \nForm W-2 . This is against IRS e-file  rules.\n\u2022Never sign a blank tax return.  Do not \nuse a tax preparer who asks you to sign a \nblank tax form.\n\u2022Review your return before signing.  Be-\nfore you sign your tax return, review it thor-\noughly. Ask questions if something is not \nclear to you. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable \nwith the information on the return before \nyou sign it.\n\u2022Preparer must sign returns and include \ntheir PTIN.  A paid preparer must  sign re-\nturns and include his or her PTIN as re-\nquired by law. The preparer must also give \nyou a copy of the return.\n\u2022Report abusive tax preparers to the \nIRS. You can report abusive tax preparers \nand suspected tax fraud to the IRS. Use \nForm 14157, Complaint: Tax Return \nPreparer . If you suspect a return preparer \nfiled or changed the return without your \nconsent, you should also file Form 14157-\nA, Return Preparer Fraud or Misconduct \nAffidavit . You can download and print \nthese forms from IRS.gov. If you need a paper form mailed to you, go to IRS.gov/\nOrderForms  to order online.

File your \npast due return and pay now to limit inter-\nest charges and late payment penalties.\n\u2022Claim a refund.  You risk losing your re-\nfund if you don't file your return. If you are \ndue a refund for withholding or estimated \ntaxes, you must file your return to claim it \nwithin 3 years of the return due date. The \nsame rule applies to a right to claim tax \ncredits such as the EIC. We hold income \ntax refunds in cases where our records \nshow that one or more income tax returns \nare past due. We hold them until we get \nthe past due return or receive an accepta-\nble reason for not filing a past due return.\n\u2022Protect social security benefits.

They use fake names and bogus \nIRS identification or badge numbers. They often \nleave \u201curgent\u201d callback requests. They prey on \nthe most vulnerable people, such as the elderly, \nnewly arrived immigrants, and those whose first \nlanguage is not English. Scammers have been \nknown to impersonate agents of IRS Criminal \nInvestigation  as well.\nBe cautious when receiving suspicious calls \nat home or at work from sources claiming to be \nfrom the IRS, other agencies, or outside sour-\nces asking for money or credit card information, \nor threatening to have you arrested for not pay-\ning.
